EMOTION,TRANSCRIPTION
ang, I did exactly what they told me to do.
ang, I've got a life too ma'am
ang, There's nothing I can do for you.  Do you understand that?  Nothing.
ang, I've been to the back of the line five times.
ang, You're going to have to go back again.
ang, Okay.  What is it that I did wrong on the form that I have to start all over again?
ang," Okay.  Well, I can do that right here right now without going to the back of the line again.  See look initialed.  All done. Ready to go."
ang, Ma'am I have other people waiting in line right now.  I have other people waiting in line right now.
ang, I'm not starting over again.  No I have done this five times.  I am not starting over again.
ang, I mean look she's -she's perfectly nice.  She doesn't mind waiting for a couple of minutes because I've been here all day. I have a job to get back to.  I have kids to pick up from school.  I can't just stay here.
ang, like I said before right now.
ang, This is your job is to help people like me who need to get a new license.
ang, You're testing my goddamn patience.
ang, I'm testing your patience?
ang," I work in this fucking building all day. And I'm sick of it, okay?"
ang, I don't need to be.  I need to go and do other things with my time.  Okay.
ang," Please just put the form in, take the picture, let me get my license and get the hell out of here.  Please."
sad, So you're leaving tomorrow.
sad, Yeah.  They just called.
sad, This is really-this is unfair.
sad, I know.
sad, I don't know what to say.  I don't want to go but I don't have a lot of choice.
sad," And, uh, I'm afraid that if you, you know, when you leave, you won't come back."
sad, I'm going to come back.  I need you to believe that.
sad, Well you have to have faith because I don't have a choice and I have to go.
sad, Do you think I want to leave you?
sad, I have to do this.  I don't want to leave.  Do you think I want to miss seeing her grow up?
sad, And now- and now it's really shitty timing but now I have to go.
sad, What's that supposed to mean?
sad, I mean we can't-we're not a complete family without you here.
ang, Well I'll come back.  What is that supposed to mean?  You're not willing to wait for me to come back?
ang, That's all I'm saying... No you don't.
ang, Thanks that helps.
ang, I feel much better now.
ang," You're acting like, you know, you're the one who's going all through, you know, all this shit and it's really- it's really not."
ang, Yeah.  Of course I do because I didn't enlist in this stupid thing.  Why don't you just get out now and then-
ang, That's how you want to leave it?
sad," I don't know how else to leave it.  What, do you want me to lie to you?"
sad, You want me tell you that I'm okay with it?
sad, I want you to be okay with it as much as you can be.  I mean it's not a great situation but we don't have an option here.
sad, Well I can't be okay with it the same way you can't not go.  It just doesn't work that way.
sad, Fine.
hap, I have something to tell you.
neu, What?  You seem so excited.
hap, It's really exciting.  Don't you want to guess?
neu," Uh, you got a new car, a new house. Uh, a dog."
hap, Look.
hap, Yes.  He finally proposed.  I'm getting married.
hap, Holy shit that's amazing.
hap, I know. I'm so-
hap, Congratulations.
hap, Thank you. [LAUGHTER]
hap," I'm invited, right."
hap, You think. [LAUGHTER]
hap," Well actually we were just talking about today and I don't really want to do like the traditional church thing, you know.  So we are going to get married in the meadow."
hap, We're going to get married in the middle of a meadow. [LAUGHTER]
hap," Everybody's going to come up. We're going to stay in all the pretty cabins up there and, um, everybody's going to have, you know, really flowery sort of naturey stuff."
hap, So pretty.
hap, Very Midsummer Night's wedding.
hap, Thanks. Thanks a lot.  You're really helping the Excitement here. I hope no one dies.
hap," Okey Well- well-, you know what?  I was hoping that you would help"
hap, plan everything.  So then you can make sure that no one gets attacked by bears.
hap, Yeah.  I'll help plan.
hap, Yeah?
hap, Really?
hap," Okay.  It's going to be in, like, six months.  So we don't have a really long time."
neu, Why not browns?
neu," It's a light brown, tanish."
neu, I just think browns are really what you want to go with.  I mean I think there's more contrast between brown and green than there is-
neu, I know but you just asked me to-
neu, Okay.  Fine.  So green and what?
neu, Blue?
neu," Okay, fine. Greens and blues."
neu, Greens and blues and maybe a little light yellow?
neu, Yeah?
hap," Throw in a little- little, uh, trim in yellow.  Maybe some yellow flowers."
neu," Okay.  That sounds good. Um, and, uh, we're going to get like a five, uh, story cake, right?"
neu," I mean, you know, you're going to have at least, like, two hundred and fifty people come.  So we're going to need, you know, just a huge buffet."
hap, Yes.
neu," Fried chicken, mashed potatoes."
hap, because you're going to take care of everything.  You're going to think of all the details that I forget.
neu, Well I can't be in charge of this.  I mean I got things I got to do.
hap, Well this is really exciting.  I mean- I just- I couldn't be happier right now.
hap, I'm thrilled.  God.
hap, Ha ha ha.
hap, Ha ha.
hap, Just ecstatic.  I can't believe you're my best friend
hap, Just couldn't be any cooler.
hap," You're my best friend, we're growing up and now you're getting married. that's amazing"
hap, I know.  I've been waiting forever.  I can't believe it's finally happening.
hap, Wow.  I just- I- I- I feel like I'm going to faint.
hap, I'm so- all the blood
hap, You don't look like you're going to faint.
hap," has just rushed to my head, and I, and I mean honestly."
hap, I'm getting a little weak in the knees.
hap, So- So when are you getting married Mr. Excited?
hap, You haven't ruined it yet.
hap, You really like
neu," I don't know.  Okay.  I mean gosh.  There's just- look there's a lot of pressure in getting married, okay."
hap, You could make her that excited.  You really like her.  You guys have been together for a really long time now.
hap, [LAUGHTER] That's more than I needed to know.
hap, [laughter]
neu, That's helpful.
neu, Well I guess you're not trying hard enough.
neu," Just, I don't know, maybe you're not smart enough."
neu, I mean I don't know just go out and keep trying. Just-
neu, I don't know.
neu," Hey.  Look, I mean- you know."
ang, I'm really good at what I do.  I just don't know how to make someone else see that.
neu, Look bananas don't grow overnight.  Okay.
ang, What?  Who says that?  Bananas don't grow overnight.
neu, You need that- Time-
neu," You know- You need to just- you need, I mean it takes time to get a good job.  I mean-"
neu," look at me, like, you know. I mean, Hey, I- it took me, you know, like six years to get where I am now. I mean-"
ang," Yeah but you weren't unemployed for three years trying to find any job.  I mean at this point I'm going to go drive a cab or, you know, work at the gas station or something.  I don't even- I don't know what to do anymore."
ang, Clearly everything you're doing is completely wrong.
neu," I mean, well I mean i don't know; it doesn't really affect my life, you know."
neu," Yeah, I understand, but-"
ang, I don't even- I mean you have to have some kind of an idea.  Something you could possibly throw out there that I could maybe use.
neu," I don't know. Well like, I don't know. I mean-"
ang, I mean it's not like this is an
ang, extreme request.  I want to find a job.  Everybody wants to find a job. It's really not that.
neu, Clearly- cle- clearly you're doing something wrong.
ang," Okay. Okay, Fine."
neu," 'Cause if you've been looking, you've been applying for jobs for three years. And-"
ang, Okey So I'm doing something wrong.  What am I doing wrong?
ang, I'm really good at what I do.  I'm smart.  I'm trained.  I have the education.  I'm talented.  I cannot-
neu, Are you- I mean do you like get dressed up and everything when you go to the job interview?
neu," And you like- you know, you shave your legs and everything?"
neu," and I want- I mean you know you've got to, like, do your hair.  I mean- I don't know, it's like,"
neu," you know what I mean? You know, it's like they say presentation is, like eighty percent."
neu, or some- some large percent of- of success.
neu," Because I don't know I mean just, you know, just keep- keep- keep at it.  Keep trying.  Go-"
ang, Well you- just you're doing something wrong.
neu," Hey, I'd love to help you but I- you don't have the kind of training that I-"
neu, Well you've got to start somewhere.  I mean-
ang, What's my problem?  What's my problem? I don't have a job.
neu, I don't know it's like I'm trying to be-
ang, I thought I was pretty clear about what the problem was.
neu, I'm trying to be helpful.
neu, I'm trying to watch TV.
ang," Lost it just, like, I mean,"
ang, it's not like it just disappeared into thin air. Somebody wasn't paying attention
ang," because my bag was very easy to keep track of.  It's got big, you know, rainbow colored crap all over it and no one was paying attention because now it's just gone."
ang, No. No. I heard- I heard what you said.
ang," You're kidding me, right.  You're going to give me fifty dollars to completely cover my bag, everything that was in it, the inconvenience that I've gone through.  I paid for my ticket.  All I expect is to safely get to my destination with my stuff.  Is that so much to ask?  I mean I really don't think that's that big a deal to ask you guys to have my bag in the place where I leave and then put my bag where I end up."
ang," Yeah, well that's got everything I have in it."
ang, Look fifty dollars is unacceptable.  My bag itself cost over a hundred and fifty dollars.  You can't just give me fifty dollar gift certificate to Percoes or whatever the hell and then send me off like that's- that's good enough.  Like that's all I needed was fifty dollars.  My bag is worth more than that.
ang, I expect your airline who was responsible for my bag to give me the equivalent of the bag and all of the things in it.
ang, I didn't sign anything. I didn't sign anything. And you people have got to make-
ang, You have to make amends for what you did for losing my bag and all of my stuff.  Fifty dollars is unacceptable.
ang, No.  No.  I don't know. You know what? I'm going to call my lawyer. You know what?  That's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to call my lawyer and have him get down here and explain to you that this is an unacceptable option.
ang, I want to talk to your supervisor.
ang," I've had enough.  I want to talk to-no, no unacceptable I want to your supervisor. I am done with this."
ang," Really, you don't work for anybody.  It's just you?"
ang," Okay.  Well I want to call whoever you report to, whoever your boss is because I have had enough with this airline and I am finished waiting for my fifty dollar gift certificate."
sad," Hey, I'm, uh. I'm really sorry about what happened.  I don't um- I mean what you can you do?  I mean it's-"
sad, Thanks.
sad," When I was seven, my- my grandmother died and I really- I don't know, I mean it was really hard to let go but the important thing is- is that you do let go and your realize that, you know, they- you know, they- this person had fun while they were- while they were here and, uh, you know, you work- you work through it."
sad," You know it's just, I just, you know, I mean it just happened.  I just, like- I just keep expecting him to walk in, you know."
sad, Mmhmm. Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean it's- it's hard.  It's hard.
sad," I just- I just thought he would have longer, you know, because I'm- I mean when he found out he was sick, we knew that wasn't good but I just- I just thought that it would take longer, you know?"
sad, Yeah.
neu," Well I mean, you know, I mean it was I mean with that kind of condition,"
sad, Yeah. I know. I know.
sad," you know, it's inevitable  and I mean honestly it's- it's almost like"
neu," you know, you don't- you know, how long do you want the person to go through that, you know."
neu, It's sort of- it's almost better off to rest in peace than he is to live in pain.
sad," Yeah, I know. But I'd rather have him here with me, you know. It's just not fair.  I mean he- he didn't get to do like anything. I mean he was-"
sad," He was only twenty four and just so many things that we were going to do, you know, and now he won't get to do them and he won't get to be here when I do.  You know, like I'll get married some day and he won't be there, like, he won't get to see that."
sad, Yeah.
sad, It just doesn't seem fair.
sad," It's not fair but I mean that's, you know, the course of life is that, you know, you meet people and you lose them."
sad, You're okay
sad, Thank you for being here.
sad, You know I think- I think we should celebrate because I think that's what he would have wanted.
hap, [LAUGHTER] You're probably right.  He probably would be pissed if we were all sitting around being upset about it. He'd want us to have a party.
neu, Yeah.
hap, And to drink in his honor. [LAUGHTER]
sad," That's right.  That's right.  I mean he would want us to, you know, celebrate the life that he- that he lived and, you know, enjoy the rest of ours as much as we can."
sad," Yeah, I know."
sad, So-
neu," Hey, what's up?"
hap, Guess what came today?
hap, What?
hap, My acceptance letter.
hap, From U.S.C..
hap," Yes, I am."
hap," Well yeah, that's the general idea. [LAUGHTER]"
hap, That's awesome.  Congratulations.
hap, Big bad acceptance packet with all the information.  I'm going to U.S.C..
hap, That's amazing.  Wow.
hap, I know. [LAUGHTER]
hap," [LAUGHTER] Yeah, uh. No."
hap, [LAUGHTER] It's safe around there.
hap, The campus is beautiful. I'm so excited.
neu, I know but you should get like a taser or something.  I mean walking around the campus at night-
hap," Do you want to buy me some mace for my, you know, going away present?"
hap, There we go.  Perfect.
hap, And a taser.  Excellent.  Just make sure it's a big knife.
hap, I don't want any of those little puny ones.
neu," So, um- so what are you going to- what are you going to major in?"
hap, Well I was thinking maybe underwater basket weaving.
hap," U.S.C. has a major in that, right."
hap, They have - U.S.C. has everything because U.S.C. is the best school ever.
neu, they have that as a major?
neu, That's ridiculous.  I don't believe that.
hap, Okay.  Well I'm lying but-
neu," Seriously, what's your major?"
hap," Well, I haven't decided yet.  I want to try some things out."
neu, So you're undecided?
neu," Hey, that's cool."
neu," No, no.  It's totally cool.  I mean, like, this friend of mine he was- he's been undecided now for, like, the past like eleven years of his life."
hap, okay.  Well I'm not going to be undecided forever. [LAUGHTER]
neu," Uh, well-"
hap, And it's so close so you can come visit me all the time.
neu, You- you- you'll find.
hap," So this works out perfectly.  Because I was worried if I didn't get in to U.S.C., then I would have to go somewhere far away and then-"
neu," You'd have to, like go somewhere else, and, you know, we would be apart, and that would suck."
hap, Everything worked out perfectly.
hap, That's awesome.
hap, I know.  We should have a party.
hap, An I got accepted to U.S.C. party.
hap, No.  An I got accepted to U.S.C. party. [LAUGHTER]
neu," Oh, that's right. Okay, I see. Right, right, right."
neu, A party celebrating your acceptance.
hap, Right.  Now you're with me.
neu, That's cool.
hap, That is why I got accepted.
hap," Well, that's really cool that you're going to be staying in the same city and everything. so umm"
hap, I know.
neu," I don't know are you, like, I don't know.  Are you, like, available or anything?"
hap," Well I mean I don't know.  It's like you know I kind of had a crush on you throughout high school and, like"
hap," I don't know I just thought that, you know, maybe we could, you know, I don't know.  It's like, you know, just test the waters anyway.  I don't see what the problem is."
hap, What- what did you have in mind?
hap," Movies- movie, we'll go to a movie and a dinner and- and"
hap," actually, you know, there's this- there's this really cool restaurant, um, I don't know if you-  it's Red Lobster.  It's like down on"
hap, [LAUGHTER]
hap, Vermont.
hap," Wait, you've been there before?"
hap, On occasion I've heard of it.
hap," Oh, so well then you know that it's awesome."
hap, Yeah.  Totally.
hap," Right, so we'll go there and then- and then we'll get some ice cream and maybe we'll go putt-putt golfing."
hap, I am totally down with the ice cream.
neu, Okay.  Putt-putt golfing?
hap," Eh, we can work that part out."
hap," Yeah, you want to go.  No, you want to go. You want to go."
hap, Alright.
hap, I can see it in your eyes.  You want to go.
hap, party.
hap, Good. Alright we're so happy.
hap," That's right.  Um, so U.S.C. is a really nice school."
hap, I know.
neu, Are you going to take out loans or-
hap, Okay well that's not a happy part.  We don't want to talk about that.
hap," Well no.  I mean I have some scholarships and some financial aid and stuff but I'll have to, you know, I'll get a job"
hap, while I'm in school.  It'll be good.
hap, Yeah.  It will work out.  Maybe I could work at Red Lobster.
hap, I know.  Right down the street.
neu," But, um-"
neu," I mean, like, I don't know.  I'm just saying if you need to make some extra cash.  You can, you know"
neu, Or library.
neu, I just said the library
neu," or, um, campus cruiser.  You can drive people around."
hap, Excellent.  Drive drunk people around because you know that's all campus cruisers for.
neu, Right or you can run for student counsel.
hap," Okay.  No, that's dorky."
neu, Dorky?
hap, Yeah.
neu, It's important.
hap, Student counsel?
hap," No, it's dorky."
neu, Fine.  It's dorky.
hap, Social life.  Hello.
neu, But that'll fit you  because you're a dork.
hap, [LAUGHTER].
hap, [LAUGHTER].
hap, I dork.
hap," No.  But I'm thinking I might, you know, like audition for a play or something.  I don't really want to do the sorority thing.  I'm not really feeling that vibe with the"
neu," Yeah, you don't want to do the sorority thing because you'll probably get used and abused by"
neu, lots of drunk frat boys
neu, Yeah.
hap, What have you heard about the Greek system?
neu," I mean it's not really free because you have to pay for it, but yeah."
neu, Well do you think you're going to live on campus or off campus your first year?
neu," I hate to break this to you but you meet people by being cool, so-"
hap," Oh, oh, I'm sorry, my bad.  I'll have to, like, sign up for summer lessons from you before I go.  You can teach me how to be cool before I go to college."
neu," No, no, no.  You're right though.  I mean, you know, dorms are definitely the way to meet people.  I know that I was in an apartment off campus"
neu," that happened, you know, that was going on."
hap, That's what you're saying. I'm right. [LAUGHTER]
hap, me.
hap, Hello.  Thank you for calling Dell Taco Corporate.  Can I help you?
neu," Um, I basically, um I- I ordered some food"
neu," Okay.  Well, Did you go through the automated menu?  Most of your requests can be taken care of through that."
neu, Okay.  Well I'd be happy to-
neu," Sir, can- can you tell me which branch you went to.  We can start there."
neu," Okay.  Um, and what was the complaint?"
neu," Can you be a little more specific, sir?"
neu," Well I'm very sorry, sir.  They should have dealt with it at that particular branch.  I apologize for that, uh, but we can help you.  That's no worries.  We can take care of that.  So how much did you need to be refunded?"
neu," It was a hundred a sixty dollars.  I'm sorry, uh, sixteen dollars."
neu," Okay.  Um, I'm going to go ahead and transfer you over to another department.  They'll need your address."
ang," Look, I don't want to be transferred over to another- All I want to do is just give you my name and address so you can send me a check."
ang," Okay.  You understand that's all I want. Just don't give me a problem with this.  Okay, please because I'm very sensitive right now"
ang," and if I get sent to another operator, I'll have to tell them the same damn story again.  I don't- I think I'm just going to lose my mind.  So if you could please just not do that, that would be great.  Thank you."
ang, You don't understand because you've never gone to Del Taco and gotten the service that I've gotten.  You don't understand.
ang, You're not going to call the other operator. You're not going to call the the other operator.
ang, You're going to fill out a form on your desk
ang, because I know you're at a desk right now in your stupid corporate building and you're going to send me a check for sixteen dollars and forty two cents.
ang, Cindy?  Cindy what?
ang," Cindy, look.  If you don't get your ass a piece of paper that has a check"
ang," attached to it and you don't send it to me, I'm going to get very upset."
ang, But I'm giving you what you want.
neu, He saw it.
sad, Did you talk to him?
sad," No, I figured the best thing was to leave him alone."
sad, I could hear him right through the floor of my room.
ang, You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?
ang," What do you want to do, argue with him?"
ang, I don't want to argue with him but it's time that he realizes that Larry's not coming back anymore.
ang, You can't say that to him.
ang, We've got to say it to him.
ang, How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?
ang, For God's sake three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.
ang, To you it is and to me but not to him.  You can talk yourself blue in the face but there's no body and no grave so where are you?
ang, The trouble is the goddamn newspapers.  Every month some boy turns up from nowhere so the next one is going to be Larry.
neu, You know why.
neu, I'm going to ask her to marry me.
neu," Well that's only your business, Chris."
ang, What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.
ang, Then it isn't just my business.
ang, Sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?  Isn't it your business too if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it.
ang, Sometimes you have a- Sometimes you have a talent for ignoring things.
ang, I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl.
ang," From father's point of view, he's not dead and you have no right to take his girl."
ang," Now you can go on from there and you know where to go, but I'm telling you I don't know where to go.  See I don't know.  Now what can I do for you?"
neu, You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that.
ang, To hell with that.
sad, I wanted to get this settled first.
ang," and then we'll thrash it out with dad, right mom.  Don't avoid me."
ang, So what I'm not fast with women.
ang, I don't see why it has to be Annie.
ang, Because it is.
ang, Well that's a good answer but it don't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went to war.  It's been five years.
sad," These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?"
ang, You marry that girl.  You're pronouncing him dead.  Now what happens to your father?  Do you know because I don't?
ang," I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I waited, dad would forget about Larry"
ang, Are you crazy?
ang, You've got a business here.  What the hell is this?
ang," The business, the business doesn't inspire me."
ang, Must you be inspired?
ang, Alright but don't think that way
ang," because what the hell did we work for?  This whole shooting match is just for you, Chris."
ang, But don't think that way.  You hear me?
ang, Yeah.  I can see that.
ang, Why did he invite her?
neu, Why does that bother you?
ang, It's been three years.  Why all of a sudden?
neu, Well maybe- maybe he just wanted to see her again.
neu, How do you know he's even thinking about it?
ang," What's going on here, Joe?"
ang," No, line."
neu," Uh, Then why is she still-she's not his girl, Joe"
ang," She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not."
neu, You can't read her mind.
ang, Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men.  Why hasn't she married?
ang, Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish but she's waited.
ang, Because she knows what I know that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.
ang," She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look, look at it.  Joe-"
ang," What does that mean, me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking."
ang, What?
neu, I guess you know this is why I asked you to come.
hap, I guess this is why I came.
hap," Ann, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you."
hap, I have no imagination that's all I know to tell you.
hap, I'm embarrassing you.  I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I
hap," Chris, I've been ready a long, long time."
neu, And he's gone forever.  You're sure?
hap, You started to write me.
hap, Every day since.
hap," I was waiting for you, Chris.  Till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say.  I mean you sure can be ambiguous you know."
hap," Give me a kiss, Ann.  Give me a-God I kissed you."
hap," I kissed Annie.  How long, how long I've been waiting to kiss you."
hap, I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I've done is sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.
hap," Annie, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy."
sad," No, nothing like that."
sad, Yes.  I suppose I have been but it's going from me.
sad, There's so many things mixed up.
sad, You remember overseas I was in command of a company?
neu," Yeah, sure."
sad, Well I lost them.
sad, How many?
sad, Just about all.
sad, It takes a lot of time to toss that off because they weren't just men.
sad," For instance, one time it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks."
sad, I put them in my pocket. that's only a little thing but these are the kind of guys I had.
sad, They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.
sad," And I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed see, but it seemed to me that there was one new thing that was made"
sad, a sort of responsibility man for man.  You understand me?
sad, And then I came home and it was amazing.
sad," I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow"
sad, because nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.
sad," I felt wrong to be alive, to open the new bank book, to drive the new car, to see the new refrigerator."
sad," when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've got to be a little better because of that."
sad, Otherwise what you have is really just loot and there's blood on it.  I didn't want to take any of it.
sad, I guess that included you.
hap," Annie, Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you."
hap, What'll I do with a fortune?
hap, What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  This is great isn't it?  Look at this night we've got here.  It couldn't be better.
neu, Fine.
hap," Is that, is that-that's just foam isn't it?  I can't even tell"
hap, I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder do they always run during a full moon.  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Remember?
neu," Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket."
hap," Ah, this is great, isn't it?  I didn't even think to bring a six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now."
ang, It's after eleven let's go home.
ang, There is no point in coming down here.
neu, That's my point too.
ang, I just don't.  It's stupid.
hap, Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.
ang," Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around, and then swim away and then they die."
hap, This is the big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy.
ang, What are you so excited about?  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats.
hap," like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.  There's mystery here and magic"
ang, I'm just not.
ang, Yes.
ang, We didn't see them the first time either.
ang, We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.
hap," I've got good instincts for these things.  Look there. What's that.  Is that?  Is that, is that-no it's just seaweed isn't it."
hap," Ah, man this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean think about this.  I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute."
hap, Out there someplace there's this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.
hap, No one sent them a map or an invitation.  Just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one. They turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.
hap, They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.
hap, It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.
hap, They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask question.  They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them here to this place
hap, where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death.
hap," Ah, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up."
ang, About what?
ang, It's ridiculous.
neu," Well, so what do you think?"
ang, It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach.
ang, Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting.
ang, We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.
ang," For heaven's sake, this is not about fish."
neu, We totally skipped. Right.
ang," For heaven's sake, grow up we are not going to see the Grunions."
ang, We never do.  Do we have we ever?
ang, Twice is every time we've tried that's ever.
ang, and the fish won't show up.
sad, We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes
sad," and you popped the cork and while we were dancing, you said the softest most intimate things to me"
sad, right into my ear so that I could hear them as much as- so that I could feel them as much as hear them.
sad," And I remember thinking this is it.  At last, at last I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be."
neu, Wait a minute.  I've got it.
sad," Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle."
neu," It was in the car right.  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?"
hap," That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time, right.  That's it."
sad, I would rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.
neu, No.
neu, You want me to get some champagne?
sad, No.
ang, No.
ang," This what, what is this?  This isn't even anything."
ang," Oh, right, sure this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting."
sad," I know you are, Augie.  Really I do.  I know you wanted this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and all but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else."
sad, Maybe if you were with somebody else too.
sad," No, I know but still.  I know I don't make you happy."
sad, somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.
neu," Actually now that you mention it, no I don't."
neu, I don't know.  It seemed like a good spot to me.
hap," Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty on the water doesn't it, big old white moon."
hap, Well look at what we got here.
hap," Oh, Augie you brought refreshments."
neu, It's not champagne.
hap, Well then I guess we don't need glasses.
hap, I'm beginning to think you might be right.  I think this may be the spot after all.  Augie I'm sorry.
hap, Ahh.  It sent shivers up my spine.
hap, What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?
hap, Behave exquisitely.
hap, With the most perfect poise.
hap, Certainly I shall probably do a court curtsy.
hap," Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they?"
neu," Don't say that, my darling."
hap, It's true the whole business is very poor joke.
hap, Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.
neu, Who's they?
hap," Oh, how long will it last, this ludicrous, over-bearing love of ours?"
neu, Well who knows?
neu, What happens if one of us dies?  Does the one that's left still laugh?
hap," Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you."
neu, Do you remember that awful scene in Venice?
hap, Which particular one?
neu, The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed.
hap," Oh, Charles.  That was his name.  Charles he did wriggle so beautifully."
neu, Horrible thing.  I hated it.
hap," Yes, I know you did.  You threw him out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that."
neu, How long did that row last?
neu, The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown.
hap, It burnt my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.
hap, Then the manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.
hap," How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous."
hap, And very much sillier.
neu," As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden."
ang, I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.
ang, You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
ang, You let him kiss you.  You said you did.
ang, What of it?
ang, What of it?
ang, What about me?
ang," That's a nice point of view, I must say."
neu," I'll have some myself, I think."
ang, It's become a habit with you.
ang," Oh, don't be so stupid."
ang," Really, Amanda."
ang, What?
ang, Nothing.
ang," Going somewhere, my dear?"
ang, It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.
ang, Adders don't snap they sting.
ang, They sting.
ang," I don't care, okay.  Do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops."
neu, Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?
ang," Yes, I did quite a lot."
ang, Mind your own business.
ang, You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk.
ang, I'm not in the least drunk.
ang, You always had a weak head.
ang," On, the contrary.  A child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy."
ang," Oh, shut up."
ang," Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy."
ang, Very good idea.  I will.
ang, Why?
ang, There is no one upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.
ang, There are people downstairs I suppose.
ang, This is no time of year for Tunis.
ang, Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.
ang, Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.
ang, You're far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.
ang," Go away, go away.  I hate you."
ang," Amanda, listen."
ang, Listen? Listen indeed.  I'm sick and tired of listening to you.  You damn sadistic bully.
ang, Stop.
ang, Very amusing.
ang," Stop, stop.  I hate you.  Do you hear?  You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible."
ang," You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast. And I hope I never see you again as long as I live."
ang," This is the end do you understand?  The end,"
ang, You're not going like this.
ang, finally and forever
ang," Oh, I am.  Let go of me."
ang, You're not.
ang," Oh, I hate you. It's a good thing that I found out in time what you're really like. Marry you again?  Never, never, never."
ang, Shut up.  Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on your bended knees.
ang," You're a mean, evil minded, little tempered witch. I hope to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live. Whore."
ang, I'd rather die in torment. Beast.  Brute.  Calf swine.
neu," Yeah, hi.  Um, look, I -- all I'm trying to do right now is renew my license plate.  That's all.  I just need to get one of those little stickers."
neu, Okay.  What's the problem?
neu," Okay, um.  Do you have your photo ID with you?"
neu," Yes, I do."
neu, Okay.  This is the wrong form.  I'm sorry.
neu, twenty bucks? Please. Go get in that line over there.
ang, It's not rocket science.
ang, So go get in the other line or leave.  Or I will have you escorted out by security.
ang, Would you like to be kicked out of the D.M.V.?  You don't think that'll be a little embarrassing?
ang," Okay, fine.  I'll go over there.  Thanks, a lot.  You've been really helpful."
ang, Yeah.  Thank you.  Have a pleasant day.
sad, It's only going to be a year.
neu," There's nothing I can do.  I mean, I have to go."
sad, You won't even know your child when you come back.  This -- isn't there someone you could talk to?
sad, When do you leave?
ang, A week.  You're giving me a week to be okay with this.
hap," Yeah, it's pretty amazing, huh?"
hap, I can't -- how did you do it?  What happened?
hap, [LAUGHTER] Well you paint a romantic picture.
hap," Well I didn't want it to be like cheesy, you know."
hap, Did she cry?
hap," She didn't cry, but she was laughing a lot and it was very exciting, so..."
hap," Oh, my God.  How long have you been planning on doing this?"
hap," Honestly, it was kind of quickly.  It was actually only in the past couple months."
hap, I can't believe this.  You're getting married. It's crazy!
hap," Yeah. Yeah. So- I know.  I know. I know.  It's weird 'cause it's like the beginning of the rest of my life, you know."
hap," Yeah, it is."
hap," But uh- no, I mean, you know.  You know, I really want you to like, you know, sort of"
hap," Yeah, I would love to. Thanks. [LAUGHTER]"
hap, Okay. Well there you go.
hap," Oh, my God, where -- have you guys talked about where you're going to get married or--"
hap," Oh, my God."
hap, Are you going to get married like on the beach barefoot or like fancier?  Like in a church.
hap, Barefoot?
hap, Well I don't know.  Throwing it out there.
hap, Yeah.  But I'm really excited.  So and everybody's going to come out and it'll be a great time.  And--
hap, It's so exciting.  What's the ring look like?
hap, It's big and shiny.  I don't know.  It's silver and--
hap, Big and shiny.  You're such a guy. [LAUGHTER]
hap," Yeah, I don't know. [LAUGHTER] But, yeah, so anyway -- well I wanted to tell you that, you know, 'cause you're one of my good friends and you're Kate's- one of her best friends and-"
hap, I'm so excited for you. That's great. I'm so-
hap," Yeah, yeah. She was actually -- she was going to tell you but I told her that I wanted to tell you and she had to work today anyway, so I decided to-"
hap," Yeah, yeah."
hap, It's fantastic.  I -- congratulations. It's amazing.
hap," Thank you.  I'm really -- I'm really excited.  And it's -- I don't know, it's like a little -- it's like a little scary, 'cause I'm like, ah, you know, it's the first time I've ever done anything like this."
hap," But, you know, it's like I really love her and I really just -- I can't imagine spending my life with anybody else but her.  So, you know, it's like I know that's the right thing.  And if you have to, you know, if you have to question that, you know, don't- don't do it.  So we're going to do it."
hap," And it's going to -- the -- you know, I told her that I just -- I want the color brown to be as an integral in the wedding.  And, um, maybe some greens and blues."
hap, She's okay with it.
hap," Well, I mean I just told her--Well I just said, you know, hey, these are my suggestions."
hap, All fruit and the color brown. Just that. That's all- that's my only request.
hap, This is why men don't plan weddings. [LAUGHTER]
hap, Yeah.  Well maybe--maybe you're right. Maybe there's something to that.
hap, All fruit and brown. [LAUGHTER]
neu," So, um, anyway, do you want to order now?   So, um I mean--"
neu, Well there has to be something you haven't tried.
neu, What about like a temp agency?
neu," Have you gone, like, signed up with a temp agency?  Maybe they can help."
neu," there's just like no jobs available.  I mean, it's just like, God."
neu," Right, but you have -- I mean, you have to keep on them.  You have to keep calling and reminding them that you're still looking and"
neu," I mean, you have to be really aggressive about it."
neu," Well, I mean, if it's that bad, maybe you're gonna have to take something that doesn't really fit, you know.  Like maybe you'll have to do something else for a while.  Find a new field, new skill."
neu," Well then you're choosing to be unemployed, really."
neu," If you're not willing to try and work with it and find something and, you know, I mean, there are things you could do."
neu," Well maybe, you know, your luck it is just down and the market for your particular field is down and maybe you just need to look into doing something else for a while."
neu," I mean, I'm not saying that you should, you know--"
neu, It's my fault 'cause you didn't do what I told you to?
neu, Well that sounds like your fault.
neu, You didn't do what I told you to do.
neu," Well, I mean, it makes sense, doesn't it, hmm?"
neu, I think maybe you can't get employed because you aren't willing to take responsibility for your own actions.
neu, That's not true.  I take responsibility for my own actions.
neu, Really?  Whose fault is it you don't have a job?
neu, Yours.  I don't--
neu, [LAUGHTER]
neu," Hi, how can I help you?"
neu, Mmhmm.
neu, I'm sorry.
neu, Right.
neu," Uh. Okay.  I -- first of all, I'm very sorry you lost your bag."
neu," Um, but, actually, our policy is a fifty dollar"
ang, fifty dollars?
neu, refund--coverage of the bag that was lost. yes
ang," fifty dollars. No way, no."
neu," That's our policy, sir."
ang," I don't but the thing is, I don't care about your policy."
ang, You understand?
neu, I can't do that.
ang," No, no, because, look, I don't care what your policy says.  I mean--"
ang, You understand that the contents of my bag- The contents of my bag cost a hundred and fifty dollars.
ang, You--
neu, We'll cover fifty.
ang, No.  No.  No.  What I need you to do -- I need you to write checks for -- I need you to write three of them. That'll be satisfactory.
ang," Just -- you can fill out the form--We can fill out - no, no, no, we can fill out the form three times."
neu, I'm very sorry.  I understand you're upset.  You just got off a long flight.
neu, I understand that.  I would know if it was mine. Um-
ang," Yeah.  If it was yours, but it's not. It's mine.  Okay. So just--"
neu, But it's not.  It's yours.  I understand.
ang, but I need to speak to somebody who can make the three check thing happen.
neu," I understand you're frustrated, but--"
neu, I know. I understand it's personal-- It's personal to you. I get that.
ang, Please.
ang," I'm already calm. Okay, I'm calm. I'm calm."
ang," Yeah.  If you were really sorry, you'd give me the three checks."
ang," So why don't we just do that and stop this nonsense, hmm?  Hmm?"
sad," Hey, how you doing?"
sad, I'm sorry.
sad, Thanks.
sad," I know- I know there's nothing I can say that will really help, but--"
sad," I know.  I just -- I don't know.  It's just weird because you have somebody who's, you know,"
sad, a major part of your life and then they're gone.  And I don't know.  That's not really -- it's never really happened to me before.
sad, I'm sorry.  It's never easy.
sad, Yeah.
sad," But, I'm here if there's anything you need.  I mean, you just have to ask.  I know --"
sad, Thanks.
sad, --it doesn't really do anything.  But--
sad, I just -- it's just not fair.
sad, I know.  It never is.
sad," How's, um -- how's his parents doing?"
sad," I mean, they're, you know, they're upset.  It's like you know, they"
sad, feel the same way everybody else does.
sad," I mean, what do you want to do?  Do you want to- do you want to talk about it?  Do you-"
sad," [BREATHING] I mean, there's nothing really to talk about.  He's gone and I'll never see him again."
sad," Well I know it's not a lot of help or anything, but at least you got to know him.  I mean, at least you had the time with him that you did."
sad, Yeah.
sad," I mean, we can be grateful for that."
sad," Yeah, I don't know.  Sometimes I wish I didn't know him.  So I wouldn't--"
sad, You feel that way now because you're upset.  But you don't really think that.
sad," It'll get better.  I know it doesn't help, but it will get better and you will remember all of the good things that you guys had; all of the memories that you have with him that were happy and you'll be grateful for those."
sad, This is just -- this is a terrible life.  I just don't understand.
sad," I mean, it's just not fair.  Like, I don't know.  Why people -"
sad," there should just be some sort of rule that people don't die until they're older, 'cause then, at least, it's expected."
sad," I agree.  If I knew how to make that happen, I would certainly help you."
sad, I don't know what to do.
sad," When's the service? Can- can we help?  Is there anything, I mean--"
sad," I mean, you- you can go.  I don't know.  I don't know what else."
sad, I hope it rains.  Somehow that'll make me feel more comfortable.
sad," Seems like if the whole world's sad, then it's okay for you to be."
sad, Yeah.
sad, I just wish there was some way to just bring him back to life magically.
sad, I know.
sad," Just, you know, some thing; some genie. I need to find a genie bottle."
sad," I don't have any magic answers.  But,"
sad," I mean, as- as cliche as it is, as long as people who loved him remember him, then it's not a waste, you know."
sad, I know.
hap," Alright, so you're not going to believe this.  But I went home today. I looked through the mail.  And I got an acceptance letter from U.S.C.."
hap, I'm going to U.S.C.. Yeah.
hap," Yeah, yeah."
hap, I didn't even
hap, know you applied to U.S.C..
hap," I did.  I did. I've -- yeah, I applied to U.S.C..  I mean, it's really expensive but"
hap, it's a really good school.  So
hap," That's amazing.  I've seen it on TV. Um, Wow.  I mean, well what are you going to major in?  What are you going to do?"
hap," Yeah.  I like to know about history, 'cause, you know, it's- it's just so relevant to the present."
hap, Right.
hap, Yeah.
hap, Yes.
hap," And, uh-"
hap, Is U.S.C. known for its history program?
hap," Um, you know, I don't think so.  But I think that, you know, it's still a private school"
hap," and right you know it's still- and then, you know, I mean-"
hap, I know.  It's a great school and you know
hap," I'm guessing, you know it's like I I checked it out.  And, like, they have a decent history program."
hap, It's all about the connections
hap," So -- and like the geology just is awesome.  It rocks, no pun intended. [LAUGHTER]"
hap," Oh, you did not just say that."
hap," Um, but, uh- anyway -- yeah, so that's awesome, though, because you live here and then we're not going to be separated by me going to some other school"
hap, I know.  You're going to be so close.
hap," And, uh, it's just really exciting.  I- You know, I'm -- just I want to- I want to share this special happy moment with you. It's awesome"
hap, I'm glad you did.
hap," That's great.  I mean, I'm really glad you're not going to go anywhere.  You'll still be here."
hap, Everything in LA is twenty minutes away.
hap, Give or take. [LAUGHTER]
hap, Well congratulations.
hap," umm, and I'm going to check out school and get, you know, check out the courses"
hap, find out all this stuff.  And- and I don't know.  I think I'm going to try to live in a dorm.
hap, Yeah.
neu," Ouch.  That's, um -- oh, wow."
hap," But, congrats on the U.S.C. thing."
neu," No, no, I mean, I didn't know -- I didn't know that about you. Um, I feel like --"
neu," The -- what, the- I mean--"
neu, I'll go to basketball games.
neu," Okay.  Well that's cool, too, but like--"
neu, Maybe some golf matches.
hap," Wow, you are a winner and a half. [LAUGHTER]"
neu, I don't know.  Do they have golf?  Do they have- Does U.S.C. have a -- I don't know if they have a golf team.
neu," No, I'm not going to go to a football game."
neu, Forget it. Forget it. Forget it. No way.
neu, I do -- I will need to get a gun-
neu," Okay.  Um, but, no, I, uh, I do need to get a gun soon, though, 'cause I mean"
neu, Excuse me?
neu, I need to get like a -- just a small little gun just 'cause -- or like a taser or something or just like a butterfly knife
neu, No.
neu," 'cause, you know, I mean, it's like If I ever want to go south of campus"
neu, Well I need to defend myself from
neu, Are you sure you didn't make them?
neu, Okay.
neu," Umm, Miss Aruckman"
neu, I am seeing the two hundred dollar charge.
neu, So you're saying that you didn't make these calls.
neu, All I can do for you right now is give you a hundred dollars.
neu, What I can
neu, What I can do for you is give you a hundred dollars right now and fill out complaint form
neu, which you- which you'll have to go into a local Verizon dealer--  or Sprint.
neu, A few weeks.  You won't even know that they were there.
neu," Yeah.  That's fine.  I just -- that's fine. Yeah, I mean, it doesn't make any difference to me.  I mean, it's not like it's going to cost my job or anything."
neu, You're just going to put it back on my account.
neu," I mean, technically, that's policy.  But, like, I mean, I don't really care about -- nobody really cares about policy here."
neu, Sure.
hap," Oh, my God, thank you so much."
neu, You're welcome.
hap," I really appreciate this. I know it's not policy or whatever but, seriously"
neu," No, no, no, it's cool.  It's cool.  It's cool.  So, um"
hap, make my life a lot easier.
neu," You know, so- I mean, are you doing anything later?  Or um"
neu," Oh, I don't know.  I mean, I don't know.  I just thought, you know, maybe you want to get some co--I mean, I'm actually -- wait, where do you live?  Oh, you're in Los Angeles, I see.  Oh, no, that sucks 'cause I'm in, actually in Alabama."
neu," God, that's like a whole problem with like-- But, no, I mean, hey-- if you ever"
neu," if you ever come out to Montgomery, I mean, you know, just -- just call up, you know, call up the operator and I'll-- I'll be here. So, um."
neu, I'll
neu," call up the Sprint call center and, uh, you know. cool"
neu, Alright. Take Care.
neu, You too.
neu, What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.
neu, He saw it.
neu, He was out here when it broke.
sad, He's getting just like after he died.  What's the meaning in that?
ang, You can't say that to him.
ang, We've gotta say it to him.
ang, How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?
ang," For God's sake, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane."
ang," To you it is and to me, but not to him.  You can talk yourself blue in the face, but there's no body and no grave, so where are you?"
neu, Why?
neu, Going to ask her to marry me.
neu," Well that's only your business, Chris."
ang, What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.
neu, Well you want to make sure your father isn't going to have --
ang," Well, then you know it's not only my business."
ang," Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  Isn't it your business, too, if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things."
ang, I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.
ang," From father's point of view, he's not dead.  And you have no right to take his girl."
neu, I wanted to get this settled first.
neu, How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does.
neu," The trouble is, you don't see enough women.  You never did."
ang, I don't see why it has to be Annie.
neu," Alright, then, mom.  Did we skip something?  No.  Alright, then, mom."
neu, Yes we did. Do you want to keep going?
neu," Yeah, let's keep going."
neu, Just give it some more thought.
sad," father forgot about Larry, we'd have a regular wedding and everything happy.  If I can't get that here, then I'll have to get out."
ang, What the hell is this?
ang, Are you crazy?
ang, You've got a business here.  What the hell is this?
ang, The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
ang, Must you be inspired?
ang," Yes.  I like getting an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening, I want it beautiful."
neu," Yes, on this I would."
ang, You don't want to think like that.
neu, Then you help me stay here.
ang," Alright.  But just don't think like that because what the hell did we work for?  That's all for you, Chris.  The whole shooting match is just for you."
ang," But don't think that way, you hear me?"
ang, Why did he invite her here?
neu," Oh, God, line."
neu, Why does that bother you?
ang," She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why, all of a sudden--"
ang, Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.
ang, He's not going to marry her.
neu, How do you know he's even thinking about it?
ang, It's got that about it.
neu, Well so what?
ang," What's going on here, Joe?"
neu, Line.
neu," Now listen, kid. Now, listen."
ang," She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not."
ang," Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men.  Why hasn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited."
ang," Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know, again, that I'm right."
ang," Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother."
ang," I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since he invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense."
ang," Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself."
ang, Laugh.  Laugh at me.  But why did that happen the very night that she came here?
ang, She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look.  Look at it.  Joe--
ang," Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone"
ang," You, above all, have got to believe.  You."
sad, I can't help it.
ang," What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?"
hap, Every day since.
hap," I was waiting for you, Chris.  'Til then, you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  You sure can be ambiguous, you know."
hap, I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I've done is sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.
sad," Yes, I suppose there has been.  But it's going from me."
sad, I don't know where to start.
sad," It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?"
sad, Well I lost them.
sad, How many?
sad, Just about all.
sad," Oh, gees."
sad, It takes a little time to toss that off because they weren't just men.
sad," For instance, one time it'd been raining several days.  And this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks; put them in my pocket.  That's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had."
sad," And I got this idea watching them go down, everything was being destroyed, see?  But, to me, it seemed there was one new thing that was made,"
sad, a kind of responsibility.  Man for man.  You understand me?  And then I went home and it was incredible.
sad," There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was some sort of bus accident.  Then I went to work for dad and that whole rat race again.  I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow"
sad, because nobody was changed.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive;
sad," to open that bank book; to drive the new car; to see the new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take these things out of a war, but when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man."
sad," You have to be a little better because of that.  Otherwise, we have is really loot and there's blood on it.  I don't want to take any of it.  I guess that included you."
hap," Annie, Annie, I'm going to make you a fortune."
hap, What'll I do with a fortune?
hap," Actually, I wanted to go a little farther up the coast, get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it.  How you doing?"
neu, Fine.
hap," Is that, is that - is that just foam?  I can't even tell.  Although, if you can't tell, it's probably isn't them.  It'll probably be unmistakable, don't you think?"
hap," How you doing?  Oh, no, you know what I did?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I should have brought my flashlight."
ang, It's not yours.
neu, Whose is it?
ang," It's ours.  It's mine, too."
ang, You kept saying my flashlight as if it's somehow just yours.  How is that supposed to make me feel?
hap," I wonder, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year.  Remember?"
ang, Yes.
neu," Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket."
neu, You want my jacket?
ang, It's after eleven; let's go home.
ang, There is no point in coming down here.
neu, Right.
neu," That's my point, too."
ang, So let's go home.
ang, I just don't.  It's stupid.
hap," Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.  Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up."
ang," Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around and then they swim away.  And then they die."
hap, There's mystery here and magic.
neu, What are you so excited about?
hap," Oh, it's a big night for these guys.  Uh, life's last orgy."
hap," Yeah, they do. Okay.  But it's fish who do something none of the other fish do; like the swallows are returning to Capistrano; or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that."
hap, There's mystery here and magic; a little bit of the unexplainable.  I don't see how you can not be interested.
ang, Yes.
ang," Last year, you will also remember, our shoes got wet.  I got sand in my panties.  We got into a big fight over nothing.  You got a sore throat and we did not see the grunions."
hap," no, it's just seaweed, isn't it?  Oh, man, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean, think about this.  I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute."
hap, Out there someplace is this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.  No one sent them an invitation or a map;
hap," just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one, they turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming."
hap, They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.  It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.
hap," They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask a question.  They just turn, as one, and start the swim that brings them here; to this place, where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.  Oh, man, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up."
hap, Well so what did you think?
neu," Look at this, goose bumps."
neu, Well so what'd you think?
neu, What I said.
ang," Goddamn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting."
ang, Well what's bugging you?
ang, We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.
ang," There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do their little fish business.  We go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home."
ang," We never do, do we?  Have we ever?"
ang," I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking this time will be the time, but it never is."
sad," It was about four years ago, right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes and you popped the cork."
neu," Wait a minute, I've got it."
sad, Dancing barefoot in the sand; drinking champagne from the bottle.
neu," It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker?  You said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?  That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time.  That's it.  Of course."
sad, I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.
sad, No.
sad, No.
ang, No.
ang, I want something to turn out the way it's supposed to.
ang," Well welcome to the human race.  You think this is what I had in mind?  You think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line, we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?  No."
ang," And we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us, 'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This."
ang, This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.
ang," Oh, right, sure.  This is standing on the beach.   This is waiting.  This is fighting."
ang, But this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.
ang," No, I know, me neither."
sad, I didn't say that.
sad," No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy."
hap," Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't."
hap," Okay, fine.  So we're in the wrong spot, but we're with the right person."
hap," I don't know.  It seemed like a good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you've got of the moon from here."
hap," Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty on the water, doesn't it?  Big ol' white moon.  I'm sorry, Augie."
hap," Shh.  If we're very quiet, the fish might come."
neu," We'll be alright, darling.  Whatever happens, aren't we?"
hap," I don't care, then."
hap," Oh, it sent shivers up my spine."
hap, What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?
hap, Behave exquisitely.
hap, With the mo- with the most perfect poise?
hap, Certainly.  I shall probably do a court curtsey.
hap, But what's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.
hap, It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.
neu," Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?"
neu," You mustn't be serious, my dear.  That's just what they want."
hap, Who's they?
ang, All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid- acid in their damn sweetness and light.
neu," If I laugh at everything, I must laugh at us, too."
hap," How long will it last, this ludicrous and overbearing love of ours?"
hap, Shall we always want to bicker and fight?
sad, No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.
hap," What happens if one of us dies?  Does the one that's left, still laugh?"
hap," Well that's serious enough, isn't it?"
hap," Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets."
hap," Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you, except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I will kill you."
hap, Which particular one?
hap," Oh, Charles; that was his name, Charles.  Oh, he did wriggle so beautifully."
ang, Horrible thing.  I hated it.
hap, I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.
hap, It went on intermittently for days.
hap," It burnt my comb, too, and all the towels in the bathroom."
neu, Line?
hap, How -- that was a rouser wasn't it?
hap, That was the first time you ever hit me.
hap," The manager came in and found is rolling about on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.  Oh, dear."
hap," How ridiculous. How utterly, utterly ridiculous."
hap, And very much sillier.
neu," As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden."
ang, That was the first time you ever hit me.
neu, I didn't hit you very hard.
hap," The manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.  Oh, dear."
hap," How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous."
hap, And very much sillier.
hap, Not at all.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often.
ang," You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?"
hap," Just a little, perhaps, nothing serious."
neu, Line?
neu, Let him kiss you.
ang, You let him kiss you.  You said you did.
ang, What of it?
ang, What of it?
ang, What about me?
ang," That's a nice point of view, I must say."
ang, So am I; bored stiff.
ang," No, thanks."
ang, It's become a habit with you.
ang," Really, Amanda"
ang, What?
ang, Nothing.
ang," Going out somewhere, my dear?"
ang," As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true."
ang," Oh, no, it isn't."
ang," Yes, it is."
ang," Oh, be quiet."
neu, Line?
neu, It's a pity you didn't- It's a pity you didn't have more brandy.
ang, It's a pity you didn't have any more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.
neu, Line?
ang," Snap.  Oh, snap, snap, snap, like a little adder."
ang," Adders don't snap, they sting."
ang," They -- nonsense, they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap."
ang, They snap.
ang, I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops.
ang," Yes, I did, quite a lot."
ang," I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then, hmm?"
ang, Mind your own business.
ang, You must have had a riotous time.
ang," No restraint at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyhow."
ang, You're quite insufferable.  I expected it's because you're drunk.
ang, I'm not in the least drunk.
ang, You always had a weak head.
ang," On the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy."
ang, Very interesting.  And how about a child of four and a child of six and a child of nine?
ang," Oh, shut up."
ang," Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy."
ang, Very good idea.  I will
ang, You better turn that off I think.
ang, Why?
ang, There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.
ang," There are people downstairs, I suppose"
ang," Turn it on again, please."
ang," Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic."
ang, Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.
ang, Go away.  Go away.  I hate you.
ang, Turn it off.
ang, You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.
neu, We swapped. Listen.
ang, Listen--
ang," Listen, indeed.  I am sick and tired of listening to you, you damn sadistic bully."
ang," You're a vile tempered, loosed living"
ang, Stop.
ang, wicked little beast. And I- I hope I never see you again as long as live.
ang, Stop.  I hate you.  Do you hear me? You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.
ang," This is the end.  Do you understand, the end?  Finally and forever."
ang, You're not going like this.
ang," Oh, yes, I am."
ang," No, you're not."
ang," Let go of me.  You're a cruel fiend and I hate and loath you.  Thank God, I discovered in time what you're really like."
ang, Shut up. Shut up.
ang," You're a mean, evil minded"
ang, Marry you again? Huh.
ang, little vampire And I hope to God I never set eyes on you as long as I live.
ang," Never, never, never.  I'd rather die in torment. Beast brute."
ang, Whore.
ang, Swine.
