neu," Oh, um-"
neu, What's wrong?
neu," You didn't fill this out right. All right. It says that you have to fill out the back sheet of this, but you filled out the yellow sheet of it."
neu, Who?
neu, She- she probably doesn't even work here.
neu, All right  Uh-
neu," How's it going, babe?"
neu, Yeah?
neu, All right.

ang," I can't- No, I can't do this alone."
sad," Yeah, and uh--"
sad," Honey, I'm going to come back. It's not like that."
sad, But it- it is for a year.
sad," Babe, I'm sorry. But I don't want to do."
sad," You know as much as -as much as me that I-I want to stay here with you and Amy so bad, but I can't."
sad, I have to work.
sad," Babe, I love you."
sad, You can't leave your daughter alone like this.
sad," But she has you. I mean, that's what you're there for. You're my right-hand man."
sad, It's going to be okay.
sad, You can't postpone it?
sad," No, I have to go."
sad," Wait, you can write me and as you know, send me pictures."
sad, I don't know if I can handle you going another year.
sad, What do you mean?
sad, I don't know if I- if I could take it.
sad," Look, I need you to be strong for me. 'Cause I can't be the only one that's strong right now, really, I--"
sad, I can't be that strong. A whole year.
sad," me, oh my god."
sad," and if we survive, if we survive that then babe, you know you know we could survive any--"
sad, I will come back.
sad, It doesn't look very good.
sad, we'll have all the money that we ever needed.
sad, And- And then I'll stop working and- I'll stay home with the baby.
sad, I don't want the money. I want-you here
ang, If your life is going to be in danger and this family is going to be in danger we don't need the job. We'll find the money.
sad, It's all I ever knew how to do. I can't quit now.
sad, How are we supposed to tell Amy? How's she supposed to understand that?
sad," Well, we- we tell her mommy's going on va- on a trip for for- a while."
sad," How is she going to feel the first year in school, no mom."
sad, Don't do that to me.
sad," It's hard enough already, Brian, I can't."
sad, I know.
sad," I didn't expect this to happen. I never planned for this. Some things you just don't plan for, you know."
sad," I'm sorry, babe."
sad, I'm so sorry.
sad," All right, then."
hap," Oh, my God, look at that. Huh-oh, how many carats is that?"
hap, Like eighteen? [LAUGHTER]
hap," Oh, Jesus."
hap, yeah [LAUGHTER]
hap," Yeah, The Lousy Chaperone. [LAUGHTER] Uh huh."
hap, [LAUGHTER] Uh- Drowsy.
hap," at the end of the performance, you know, like we're all clapping and stuff. And all of a sudden I look over and"
hap," Joe's gone. -where did he go, you know?"
hap," And I'm like oh, he went to the- -the bathroom, but he didn't tell me, I didn't even notice him leaving. And all of a sudden, I swear to God, I'm sitting there and-"
hap, he comes up onstage-- And the entire cast everyone just like
hap, goes up there and everyone's clapping and he's standing there and they put a spotlight on him.
hap," Oh, my God."
hap," And I'm like freaking out. I'm like what the hell's going on, you know. I don't know what's going on. And so he's like standing there and then all of a sudden they give him a microphone-"
hap," he asked me to marry him, like- onstage. I was like, I couldn't believe--and I had to walk up there and I was, like I think I tripped or something."
hap," Yeah, I said yes, but I, yeah, I mean,"
hap," I don't know- it just like took me, took me by surprise."
hap, He scored points.
hap," Oh, yeah. Everyone--yeah. And people--friends of ours were in the audience, I didn't know about, like family members."
hap, Yeah. It was great.
hap," It was--I cried,"
hap," No, you deserve to cry. I mean, tears of happiness."
hap," like a loser, I cried."
hap," But, I don't know, I--it's so weird to think I'm marrying somebody 'cause I feel so young, you know?"
hap, No. No plans. or any- and probably
hap," like I think I want to get married--I want to have two weddings. One here, then one in Europe."
hap, That's awesome. [LAUGHTER] Marriage.
hap, Yeah. I'm so excited. [LAUGHTER].
neu," Hey, you just got to keep on going."
neu," No, don't think like that."
sad," I just, I see all these other people getting commercials and work and it's like I'm not getting anything."
neu, Russel Crowe wasn't forty until he got his big stuff.
neu," If you really want to do it-I mean,"
neu, you got to do.
neu, You could. You could. We just--
neu, we're just pooling our funds together.
neu, You don't owe me anything.
neu," You are, you're going to class, you're learning, you're getting better. When you finally get that role you're going to be prepared."
neu," Oh my God, Anna, you're still young. Don't even think about that."
neu," You're only twenty five, okay? Some people don't start until they're thirty five."
neu, Yeah.
neu, What would you do- What would you do if you didn't? You can go to law school.
neu, See? So you can't just quit now.
neu, Have you been going to auditions and stuff?
neu, How's the job? Still waiting tables at Denny's?
neu," Well, they tip well."
sad, it's not funny. I just don't know what I'm going to do.
neu, Maybe you could start teaching. I don't know.
sad," Yeah, I guess I could."
neu," Go back to school. You know? Another three more years, get your master's."
sad, Yeah
neu," Close to thirty. Oof, it's going to be tough."
ang," Where? I don't know. The lost and found. What do you mean, lost and found?"
neu," Oh, not--we didn't lose it; maybe the airport lost it. Maybe someone stole it."
ang," Wait, sir. You're- You're completely not--what do you mean, stole it? How can they just steal it from an airplane? It was up in the air?"
ang," What do you mean, if it shows up? No, I need it now. I have my keys, I have my wallet, I have my money. I have thousands and thousands of dollars worth of stuff in there."
ang, Not to mention I have my work in there.
ang," And what if- what if it is lost? Well, what are you guys going to do for me?"
neu, and when you sign your ticket we could replace about fifteen percent of what's in the bag.
ang, Fifteen percent?
neu, Up to a limit of twenty five dollars.
ang, What? There- There's hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stuff in there.
neu," I think that's kind of stupid, that you put a hundred thousands of dollars in the bag."
ang," No, they said I couldn't lock it."
ang, Give me--I'm going to talk to your supervisor. Give me your supervisor. I want to talk to your supervisor right now.
neu," Okay, let me get him.Oh, guess who the supervisor is? It's me."
neu," What, do you have questions?"
ang," Well, get- I want the C.E.O. then."
neu, How you doing?
sad, Okay.
sad, Yeah. Wow.
neu, We're all going to miss him.
sad," Mmm hmm. I never knew it was going to be this hard, you know."
sad, It's weird 'cause it's like you expected it to happen and eventually-
sad," he had cancer, you know?"
sad," They thought he got--would get better and he did, and then it just- things turned bad."
sad," Turned around for the worst, you know."
sad," I didn't know him, Tricia, but uh- I heard that he was a great man."
sad, He was amazing.
sad, I loved that boy.
sad," We did everything together, you know."
sad," It's weird, I think. I feel so alone, you know? What am I going to do now? Now that he's gone."
sad, He's so young. It seems so--
sad, so wrong in so many ways.
sad," His poor parents. You know, it's their only son."
neu, yeah.
sad," Kind of a whole year. I mean, he suffered with this, this monster, this thing, this disease."
sad," He was in chemo the whole time, right?"
sad, And he just got that baseball scholarship.
sad," I know. He was, he had so much going for him."
sad," So handsome, so young, so gifted."
sad, So talented.
sad," Such a sweet person, you know?"
sad, How's his parents doing?
sad, Not very good.
sad," Can you imagine, though, you know, as a parent, just losing a kid? Twenty-two years old."
sad," It's weird, I kind of feel like part of me is gone now, you know?"
sad, Because this other half was just kind of like ripped away.
sad," You guys were pretty close, weren't you?"
sad," He was like, he was like my brother, you know."
sad, He was my brother.
sad," Just seems so unfair, is the way it is."
sad," You know, he had that really pretty girlfriend for like about a year and-"
sad, What was her name?
sad, Kelly. Kelly Uveny.
sad, They talked about getting married and--
sad, Trying to have a baby.
sad," Yeah. But then when he got cancer and it got bad, you know, she just took off and-"
sad, so I was there for him.
sad, Some people.
sad," Yeah, but you were there all the hospital days. By his bed-"
sad," Yeah. God, I loved that kid."
sad," So nice, so positive."
sad, yeah.
sad, We need more people like him.
sad," Joe, do you think he knew I loved him?"
sad, I don't know.
sad," I never told him, I love you, but-"
sad, I loved him so much.
sad, I don't know if Benny was smart like that- but-
sad, I'm sure he loved you too. He just didn't know it.
neu," Hey, Isabella."
neu, I'm all right.
hap," Uh-, So I got some good news."
neu, You're not pregnant or anything.
neu," I know you've been trying to have a baby, right?"
hap, I have some better news than that.
hap," Yes, What would you want more than anything in this world?"
hap, Which one?
hap," I got--U.S.C.. I got- Yeah, I got the acceptance letter."
hap," Yes, me, I got in. Thank you very much."
hap, Good for you.
hap," Yeah, I know, my mom called me. I was with my girlfriend in Boston, and uh- she got the letter and she called me, she said I don't know, do you want me to open it? And I was like yes, open it. And she opened it and she goes oh, I'm sorry, Nat."
hap," And my mom was like Natalie, Natalie, it's [GARBAGE], you know-"
neu, oh yeah.
hap," and so, I mean, I got in."
hap," Oh, Jesus. That is so amazing."
hap, So now I can stay here and now we can party. I know.
hap, Party. You want to get drunk tonight?
hap," Yeah, why not."
hap," Yeah, we're going to celebrate."
neu," We're not twenty one yet, but whatever."
hap," [LAUGHTER]. I'm so excited, Joe. Oh, man, I-- And I got in--I got into the school of theatre, so it's like-"
hap, Yeah. It's really cool.
hap, Top five in the nation.
hap, Who-whooooo. Miss Acti- Acting Pants.
hap," Acting Pants? So what are you going to do? Are you--you're be--you're going to stay here, right?"
neu, I got into film school at the Art Academy.
hap, Awesome. We're both going to be in L.A.
hap, So I'm going to be--yeah. I'm going to make films; you're going to be in them.
hap," I'm so excited. Yeah, I thought I was going to go to Boston, but then--"
neu, Fuck Boston.
hap," Oh man, I'm so excited. So much to do."
hap, I'm just so excited to start my life.
neu, We should uh- go to Little Ethiopia.
hap," Oh, and you sit down and you have the sponge bread-- --and eat the--drink the beer. Ugh, I love that stuff. I'm so excited."
hap, Are you going to come stay in my dorm with me sometime?
hap," Hell, yeah. Pass out."
hap, Yeah. I'll get like one of those little--
hap, Yeah. Those little-- --mattresses. I'll put it by my bed.
hap, -drunk.
hap," No, I'll sleep in your bed. Cuddle up."
hap, Uh-oh.
neu, That's going to--that'll be reserved for somebody else.
hap, [LAUGHTER] Hello? I am not.
hap, Yeah.
neu," Well, get used to it."
hap," [LAUGHTER]. No, you'd get used to it."
hap," Hey, I'm already getting used to it."
hap," [LAUGHTER]. Oh, Joe, I'm so happy."
hap," Me too, Isabella."
ang," Hey, you stupid dumb shit machine, give me a fucking operator, huh?"
neu," Hello sir, can I help you?"
neu, I [GARBAGE]
neu," Yes, sir, I'm very sorry, but we've had some trouble here.  There's been a lot of calls and the system has-"
neu," Sir, please calm down.  There's no reason to use profanity like that.  It's not-"
neu," Okay, and this is for Verizon? Your provider?"
neu," Well, um- we have a little problem with the system going on.  One of our satellites is down, and I-"
ang, You know what?  I'm just going to- Patient?  I'm a busy man.
neu," You're going to have to just be patient with us, sir, as we"
neu," Well, I know sir, and we all are busy."
neu, But I'm going to definitely have to- uh--get your contact information
ang," -have to, have to what?"
ang, What?  It's my phone.  You can't even call me on it. I don't have another phone.
neu," Okay, well, if you would like, um- we will be turning on the systems in probably about ten hours."
ang, What?  Are you kidding me?
neu," Sir, I'm very sorry, but this is the way it is.  This- We have no control over it.  It's going to take-  -but you have to be patient with us.  You can use a calling card.  We will give you a free calling card to use."
ang," Oh, my God."
ang, I- I'm going to kill myself right now.
ang, A free calling card?
neu," Do you have a land line, sir?"
neu," Okay, well, we will send you- We will reimburse you for the amount of minutes that you-"
neu, -on average would use.
ang," That's it? Okay, yeah.  What else?"
neu," And we will probably send you a calling card.  I'm very sorry.  You're just going to have to be patient, sir."
ang," Okay, I need more than this.  Are you going to give me a little bit more?"
neu," No, we don't just give you things.  We're- we're-"
neu, we compensating you for all your-
neu, Three days?
neu, A day?
neu," I don't know, sir."
neu, About three million dollars.
neu," Oh, well, I'm sorry about that. Umm- We-"
neu," Well, ten hours worth of minutes--"
neu, is what's going to happen.
neu," Sir,"
neu," what I would like what I'm advising you to do now is just to write down all of your problems that you-you feel that--You know, haven't been addressed, fax it to us-"
neu, and we will take care of it if anything happens.  But all we can do now is ask for your patience.
neu, Okay? Thank you for calling.  Goodbye.
neu, He saw it.
neu, He was out there when it happened.
neu," Um, about four this morning. Uh- I heard a crack and I looked out and I saw him standing there."
neu, I don't know. But after it cracked he went back in the house and he cried in the kitchen.
neu, Did you talk to him?
neu," No, I uh-, I figured the best thing to do was to leave him alone."
neu," He cried hard, huh?"
neu, I could hear it right through the floor.
neu, I guess he is.
neu," Could he-he's acting just like he did after he died, you know?"
neu, I don't know.
neu," But I know one thing, mom. We've made a terrible mistake with dad."
neu, Being dishonest with him. That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.
neu," What do you mean, dishonest?"
neu, They do come back.
ang," It's those Goddamn newspapers, you know? I mean, it's like every day they come out with this new person that comes along. And the next one's going to be Larry."
neu," You know-you know why I asked Annie here, right?"
neu, Why?
neu, You know.
neu, I want to ask her to marry me.
neu," Well, that's only your business, Chris."
neu, So it's all right. I'll just go ahead with it.
ang," See, then it's not just my business. God, you have"
ang," -Oh, you infuriate me sometimes. You know, it's not just my business too if dad throws a fit."
sad," Every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole entire life, time and time after time."
neu, You're a considerate fella and there's nothing wrong in that.
ang, To hell with that.
neu, There's nothing wrong with it.
neu, I didn't ask Annie yet.
neu, I wanted to get this settled first.
neu, Well then I guess it's over then. But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.
neu," I'll find out. But then after it's all over we'll thrash it out with dad, right?"
neu, Because it is.
neu, It just is. I-
neu, But if I can't have that here then I'll get out.
neu, I'll get out. I'll marry her somewhere else. Maybe New York.
ang, Yes. I like it an hour out of the day. If I have to grub for money all day long at least that evening I want it beautiful. I want a wife. I want a family. I want some kids. I want to build something I can give myself to.
ang," Now, Annie's in the middle of all that."
neu," Now, where do I find it?"
neu, Tell me something.
neu, You'd leave that business.
neu, Yes. On this I would.
neu, Then help me stay here.
neu, Okay. Just-
neu, I'm going to.
neu, I am thinking like that.
neu," I don't know you, do I?"
neu," No, you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy."
neu, Yeah. I can see that.
ang, Why did you invite her here?
ang, She's been in New York for three-and-a-half years. She don't just suddenly come and-
neu," Well, maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her."
ang, You don't travel seven hundred miles just to see.
neu, How do you know he's even thinking about it?
ang, It's got that about it.
neu," Well, so what?"
ang, She's not Larry's girl. She knows that.
neu, You can't read her mind.
neu, How do you know why she's waited?
sad," She's faithful as a rock, don't you know. In my worst moments I can think of her-"
neu," Look, it's a nice day. What are we arguing for?"
ang," Nobody in my house better ever dare-dare to challenge her faith. Maybe strangers, but not his father, not his brother."
neu, Calm yourself.
ang," Don't, don't laugh at me, don't laugh at me."
ang," Look at it. Because why, when she came here and she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Look at it, look at it, Joe."
ang, All right. All right. Calm yourself.
sad," No, you've got to believe."
ang," Why me, above all?"
ang, Huh?
ang, Why me above all?
sad, You got to keep believing.
ang," Look at you, you're shaking."
sad, I can't help it.
ang, What have I got to hide?
ang," Huh? What the hell's the matter with you, Kate?"
hap, You're the only one I know that still loves his parents.
hap," Yeah. I know. It went out of style, didn't it?"
hap," No, it's all right. There's nothing wrong in that, you know."
hap, It's really lovely here. The air is sweet.
neu, You're not sorry you came?
sad, No. I'm not sorry. It's-
neu, Well-
neu, What?
sad," Well, you've been embarrassed ever since I came."
hap," Oh look, um, well, the thing is, I was planning on, planning on sort of sneaking up on you over a week or so, and they-they take it for granted we're all set."
hap," I, I guess that's why I asked you to come."
hap," Well, I mean,"
hap," Oh, Annie."
hap," from her opinion, why else would I come here?"
hap," Annie, I love you."
hap, I love you a great deal.
hap, I-I love you. I have no imagination. That's all I know how to tell it.
hap," Well, I guess that's why I came."
hap," I'm embarrassing you. I didn't want to tell you it here. I wanted to go somewhere that would be brand-new to each other. It feels wrong here, don't you? This yard and this chair."
hap, I don't want to win you from anybody. I want you to be ready for me.
hap," I've been ready for a long, long time."
hap, You felt something that far back?
hap, Every day since.
hap, Why didn't you let me know?
hap," Give me a kiss, Annie."
hap, Give me-
hap, I don't know if I ever can forgive you for that. Why'd you wait so long? I sat in my room wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you.
hap, We're going to live now. I'm going to make you so happy.
hap, I kissed you.
hap," Like Larry's brother. Do it like you, Chris."
sad, Let's drive somewhere. I want to be alone with you.
sad, No. What is it? Is it your mother?
neu," No, no, no, no. Nothing like that."
sad," Well then tell me what's wrong. I mean, even in your letters there's something ashamed."
sad," Yeah. I guess there is. I guess I was, but uh- it's going from me now."
sad, You should tell me.
sad, I don't know where to start.
sad," But, Chris, it wouldn't work like this."
sad, You know when I went overseas. I said I was in command of a company.
sad," Yeah, sure."
sad," Well, I lost them."
sad, How many?
sad, Just about all.
sad, Geez.
sad, It takes a little while to toss that off. Because they weren't just men.
sad," For instance, one time, it had to have been raining several days. There was this one kid, he came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks. Put them in my pocket."
sad," I mean, that's-that's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had. They didn't just die. They killed themselves for each other. And I mean that exactly. A little more selfish and they'd still be here today."
sad," And I, and I thought something watching them go down."
sad," Everything was being destroyed, see, but there was one new thing that was being created. A kind of responsibility, man for man. You understand me?"
sad, And to show that-to bring that onto the earth like some sort of monument standing right behind us where everyone could feel it and it would make a difference to him.
sad, And I came back here and it was incredible. There was no meaning in that here. The whole thing to them was a bus accident.
sad, And I went to work with dad and that rat race again. And I felt what you said-ashamed somehow. Because nobody was changed at all. It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.
sad," And I felt wrong to be alive. To drive the car, to see the new checkbook, to see the new refrigerator. I mean, you can take those things out of the war. But you got to know that when you drive that car that that came out of the love a man can have for another man. And you got to be a little bit better because of that."
sad," Otherwise, what you have here is loot; and there's blood on it."
sad, And I didn't want to take any of it.
sad, And I guess that included you.
sad, And you still feel that way?
sad," Because you can't feel that way, never again, Chris. You hear me? Never. I mean, the money and me too."
hap," Annie,"
hap," Annie, I'm going to make a fortune for you."
hap, What am I going to do with a fortune?
hap," Hey, what time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight, right? God, this is great, isn't it?"
hap, Look at the night we got; couldn't be better.
hap," You know actually, I wanted to go a little further up the coast to get away from all the, the people and the lights, and uh- but I thought we'd miss it. Hey, how you doing?"
sad, Fine.
hap," Oh, is that-is that-now, is that just foam, uhh, I can't even tell."
hap," Oh, though if I can't tell it probably isn't them, right? It probably would be unmistakable, wouldn't you think? Hey, how you doing?"
hap," Oh, do you know what I forgot? I forgot my flashlight. How could I be so stupid. Oh, I-I should have brought my flashlight."
hap," Uh- you know, the flashlight. The silver one. There's only one, isn't there?"
ang," I don't understand why you're always saying oh, it's mine, it's mine. It's not like it's just your flashlight. I mean, how do you think that makes me feel?"
hap, We should have brought our flashlight. I can't believe we forgot to bring it.
hap, I hope the moon stays out.
hap," Hey, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year. Do you remember?"
hap," We should have brought the blanket. Oh, why didn't we bring the blanket? Our blanket."
hap," You know what would be good right now? A six-pack. Ah, I can't believe I forgot a six-pack. A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now."
hap, I'm so stupid. I'm like a little kid. I-it's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh- [LAUGHTER].
hap, I wonder if they can hear us talk. Or hear the vibrations in the sand when we move.
neu, Do you want my jacket?
neu, Right.
neu," Yeah, that's my point too."
hap," No. No, no, no, that's not my point. My point is there's no point in coming down here if we just turn around and leave."
neu," I mean, don't you want to see it?"
sad, Not particularly.
neu, Why not?
sad, I don't know. I just don't.
ang, Pass up what? A bunch of fish. They swim up to the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.
hap," I wouldn't miss this for anything. I mean, think about this. Okay, I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute."
hap," And they all, all as one, turned as one and formed this line as big as the California coast and started swimming this way. Swimming as if that's the only thing that matters."
hap," You know, they didn't ask it a question. They didn't, they didn't take a vote. They didn't have an invitation or a map; they just started swimming as one."
hap," its single-mindedness with one mind. Urgency that's pure urge. You know, they don't give it a name."
hap," They don't ask it a question. They just, they just, they don't know what drives them. They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them to here"
hap," where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death. Oh, God, I'm giving myself goosebumps. Look, I'm all-all my hairs on my arms is sticking up."
neu, About what I just said.
neu, About what?
neu, About what I was just saying.
neu," Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period?"
ang," Augie, Goddamn it, don't ask me that. You always ask me that. Why do you ask me that? I hate it. It's insulting."
neu, We're not seeing the grunions?
ang, Like I feel like my whole life I've been just standing on this beach with my hands clasped waiting for these fish to show up and these fish never show up.
sad, Do you remember the last time we came here?
sad, We thought I was pregnant.
sad, You brought a bottle of champagne.
hap, We took off our shoes and we danced barefoot in the sand. Under the moon.
hap, And you whispered so intimately in my ear so I could feel your words.
hap," Oh, that moment-that was it."
sad," I told myself finally, this is how happy I'm supposed to be."
neu, Wait a minute. I got it.
hap, Dancing barefoot in the sand. Drinking out of a bottle of champagne.
sad, I don't want to remember something.
sad, Hope for some things.
sad, No.
sad, No.
sad," No, no."
ang, No.
ang," A-a back rub, some ice cream, a suicide pact. What the hell do you want, Carla?"
ang," No, it's not. It's standing on the beach waiting and fighting."
sad, Things have never turned out anything the way that I thought they would be.
sad, it's not something else. Do you know what I'm trying to say?
sad," I know you are, Augie, and I know you wanted this evening to be nice, but I can't help thinking of being somewhere else."
sad, I didn't say that.
hap," Actually now that you mention it, no, I don't."
hap," Well, I guess we're just in the wrong spart-spot with the right person."
hap," Seemed like a pretty good spot to me. I mean, look at the view of the moon we've got from here."
hap, I noticed that. It's beautiful.
hap, You can see right over the water.
hap, Look what we got here.
hap, It's not champagne.
hap, At least we won't need glasses.
neu, Are you still cold? Do you want to go home?
hap, Maybe this is the right place after all.
sad," I'm sorry, Augie."
neu, Shh.
hap, If we're very quiet the fish might come.
hap, Or not.
neu, [BREATHING]
neu, Do you think it's them?
neu," We're all right, aren't we darling? Whatever happens."
neu, Then I don't care.
hap," things that should matter dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy, do they?"
hap, Don't laugh at me. I'm serious.
hap," [LAUGHTER]. You mustn't be serious, my dear one, that's what they want."
hap," Ooh, certainly you must. We're figures of fun, all right."
sad," Oh dear, well, shall we want that?"
sad," Well, what if happens if one of us is to die? Does the one that's left still laugh?"
hap," Let's blow strumpets, blow-blow trumpets and squeakers and party as much as we can like small quite idiotic school children. Let's savor the delight of the moment. Come, kiss me darling, before worms pop in and out of your eye sockets."
hap," Thank you, dear. The same applies to you. Except that if I ever so much as catch you looking at another woman I'll kill you."
hap, Remember that awful scene we had in Venice?
hap, Oh Charles. That was his name. Charles. He did wiggle so beautifully.
hap, yeah. And that was the first time you ever hit me.
hap," That was a rouser, wasn't it?"
hap, The manager came in and found us rolling on the floor and biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER]
hap, I know. Oh man. Couldn't believe it.
ang," As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden."
ang, I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.
ang, I remember it well. Bristling with diamonds. In the worst possible taste.
neu," Just a little perhaps, but it was nothing serious."
ang, You let him kiss you. You said so.
ang, What about me?
ang," That's a nice point of view, I must say."
neu," Well, it's true."
neu, Are you bored with this conversation?
neu, So am I. Bored stiff. Want some brandy?
neu," I'll have a little, I think."
neu," No particular reason. Anyhow, they were very small ones."
neu, It's become a habit with you.
ang, You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want some yourself at the moment.
ang, Don't be so stupid.
ang," Really, Amanda."
ang, What?
ang, Nothing.
ang," Going somewhere, dear?"
neu," It's a woman's job to allure the man. Watch me, won't you, a minute?"
ang," No, it isn't."
ang," Yes, it is."
ang, They snap.
ang," I don't care. I don't care, do you understand? I don't care if they bark, if they roll over on the floor like hoops."
ang, did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?
ang," I imagine that you let him kiss you quite a bit more then, didn't you?"
ang, You had a riotous-must have had a riotous time. No restraint at all. Very enjoyable. You never had much anyhow.
ang, You are quite insufferable. I suppose it's because you're drunk.
ang, I'm not in the least bit drunk.
ang," Okay. As I mentioned before, I said I had three very minute liquor glasses. That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk."
ang," Well, I suppose the people downstairs then."
neu, This is no time of the year for Tunis.
ang, Turn it on.
ang, Turn it off.
ang, I will not. Go away. Go away. I hate you.
ang," Oh, very amusing, indeed. Amanda, listen-"
ang," Listen, indeed. No, no, no, no. I am sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully."
ang, Very amusing indeed.
ang," Stop it, stop it, I hate you, I loath you, you are overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible."
ang," You know, you're a vile, ill-tempered, wicked little beast and I hope that I never see you again as long as I live."
ang, This is the end. Do you hear? The end. Now and forever.
ang," No, you're not going out like this. No you're not."
ang," Oh, yes I am."
ang," Yes I am. Let go of me. I hate you and I loath you. God, I can't believe I just finally realized how you are. I am never marry you. Never. Never, never, never. I would rather die in torment."
ang," Oh, shut up. Shut up. Shut up."
ang," I wouldn't marry you again if you came back crawling to me on your hands and knees because you're vile. You're a mean, evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never set eyes on you again."
ang," Beast or brute cad, swine beast beast brute."
neu, Is that a demand sir?
neu, No.  You filled out the back part.  You were supposed to fill out the front portion only.
ang, What are you talking about?  It says fill out that part.

sad, I can't do this.
neu," You can do it.  Alright?  You can, you can be strong, you can be strong for both of us alright?"
sad, I'm sick of being strong-- --for us.

neu," Um- well it's probably easy.  Can you any more symptoms either you're not receiving calls----ok, you're not receiving calls, not getting calls."
neu, Is the phone turned on?
neu," Well, um- okay.  Your sim card is in- didn't fall out-"
neu, Alright.  Um- Well that could be the problem. cause--
neu, you might have an older phone where we would use sim cards but probably not.
neu, Okay.  How about this we'll send you a brand new camera phone with palm pilot-- and-
neu," So we'll send it- And we'll give you, how about a free year's service?"
neu, Tell them my name.  My name is Brent Backersen.
neu, Okay.  Tell them my - my ID number is two one three five.
neu," Tell them that.  You can go in, get a brand new phone, they'll hook you up with service even give you a free three months--"
neu, It will be free.  No contract okay?
neu," Go in there, yeah, go in there.  Tell them Brent Backersen sent you."
neu," the top of the line camera phone, game boy, anything you want. For free. And palm pilot."
neu, They might only have orange.
neu," Okay.  They can figure out pink for you.  So go in there and just tell them that and they'll hook you up with other goodies, stuff like that free service, no contract, no nothing.  Just for being a good customer"
neu, and battling through with us.
neu," Alright. Well-  I guess - I guess that's okay but,"
neu, Yes.  You just tell them Brent Backersen sent you.
neu, Okay.
neu, Alright?  Great.  Have a nice evening.
neu, Alright Thanks.
neu, What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to talk to him before he sees it.
sad, He saw it.
sad, He was out there when it happened.
sad, About four in the morning.  I heard a crack and I looked out and he was standing right there when it happened.
sad, I don't know. But after it cracked he ran back into the house and he cried in the kitchen.
sad, Did you talk to him?
sad, No.  I figured the best thing to do was leave him alone.
sad, He cried hard?
sad, I could hear it right through the floor.
sad, I guess he is.
sad," He's getting just like he did after he died, you know?  What, what, what's the meaning of this?"
sad," I don't know.  But I know one thing mom, we made a terrible mistake with dad."
ang, You know that Larry's not coming back and I know that too.  Why we both go on letting him think that we both believe with him.
ang," Why shouldn't he walk around and dream at him at night.  Walk around.  Why shouldn't he walk around?  Why shouldn't he dream of him, walk around at night waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say flat out that we don't have anymore hope?"
ang, That we haven't had any hope for years now?
ang, No.  It's his god damned newspapers is what it is.  Now every month there's a new boy comes home and Larry's going to be the next one.
neu," You know why I asked Annie here, right?"
ang, Why?
neu, I want to ask her to marry me.
ang," Well what do you want me to do?  I mean, you're old enough to know your own mind."
neu, Okay.  So then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it.
neu," Well, I mean, you got to make sure your dad's not going--"
ang, Oh see then it's just not my business. God you infuriate me sometimes.  Isn't my business too if dad throws a fit?  Huh?  God you have such a talent for ignoring things.
ang, Well to hell with that.
neu, Did you ask Annie yet?
neu, I wanted to get this settled first.
neu, Then I guess that's the end of it.
sad, But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.
neu," And then we'll thrash it out with dad right?  Mom, don't avoid me."
neu," Look, you never had seen many, many women.  You know?  I mean..."
sad, I've given it three years of thought and I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.
neu, But if I can't have that here I'll get out.
neu, I'll get out.  I'll marry her somewhere else.  Maybe New York.
ang, I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker and I'm through with it.
ang, You're just going to leave the business?  You have a business here.  You can't do that.
ang, The business doesn't inspire me.
ang, Yes.  I like it an hour out of the day.  If I have to grub for money all day long at least at evening I want it beautiful.  I want a family.  I want a wife.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to.
sad, Tell me something.  You can leave this business?
neu, Yes.  On this I would.
ang," I mean what the hell have we worked for then?  I mean, it's all for you Chris.  The whole shooting match is for you."
sad, I know.  Just you help me stay here.
sad, I am thinking like that.
sad, I don't understand you do I?
sad, No you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.
sad, Yeah.  I can see that.
ang, Why did he invite her here?
ang, Well she's been away for three and a half years in New York and suddenly she just shows up.
neu," Well maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her."
neu, Who said he even thought about that?
neu," Well, so what?"
ang, No.  She's not his girl Joe and she knows that.
neu, How do you know why she's waited?  Hmmm?
ang," I mean, her faith is stronger than a rock."
sad," My worst times I think about her, you know, and I"
sad, it's like I know as long as she's waiting I'm right again.
ang," No.  Nobody in my house better dare and challenge her faith.  You know and maybe strangers but not his father, not his brother."
ang," Laugh, laugh at me but I will.  Because you know what happened when she came here?  When she came back she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Joe, look. Look at it. You got to believe with me."
sad," Look, it was just last week that Detroit, some boy came back he had been away longer than Larry, you can read it for yourself. You above all people have got to believe."
ang," Alright, alright, calm yourself okay?  Calm yourself. Wait, wait.  What do you mean, me above all?"
ang," Wait, what does that mean?  Me above all?"
ang," Look at you, you're shaking."
sad, I can't help it.
ang, What do I got to hide?  Huh?  What the hell's the matter with you Kate?
neu, You're not sorry you came?
sad, No.  I'm not sorry.  But I'm not going to stay.
sad," Look,"
sad," you saw the way that she acted and then well, I mean, you, you were acting kind of..."
neu, What?
sad," Well, I don't know, embarrassed of her since I came."
hap," I mean, that's the reason why I asked you here."
hap," Well,"
hap, I love you.
hap, I guess that's why I came.
hap," Look, I've been ready for a long, long time now."
hap," Look, I almost got married two years ago."
hap, You started to write me.
hap, You felt something that far back.
hap, Every day since.
hap," I was waiting for you Chris, I mean, till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say?"
hap, You'd always be so ambiguous.
hap," Give me a kiss Ann, just give me..."
hap," Oh God.  Annie, I kissed Annie.  I kissed Annie."
hap, I'll never forgive you for that.
hap," I mean,  Why did you wait all these years?  There I was sitting around and wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you."
hap, We're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.
hap, Not like that you're not.
sad," Nothing.  Hey, let's drive somewhere.  I want to be alone with you."
sad, You remember overseas I was in command of a company?
sad, Well I lost them.
sad, How many?
sad, Just about all.
sad, Geez.
sad, Takes a little while to toss that off cause they weren't just men.
sad," For instance, one time this...it had been raining several days and this one kid, he came up to me, he gave me his last pair of dry socks, put them in my pocket."
sad," That's just a little thing but that's the kind of guys I had.  They didn't just die, they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly."
sad, A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.  And I got this idea watching them go down.  See everything was being destroyed but there was one new thing that was being created.
sad," It was a kind of responsibility, man for man.  You understand me?"
sad, And to show that and to bring that onto the earth again like some sort of monument standing right behind all of us and we could feel it and it would make a difference to him.
sad, And then I came here and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was a kind of bus accident.
sad," And I went to work with dad and that rat race again and I felt what you said, ashamed.  Somehow because nobody was changed at all."
sad," It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive.  I felt wrong to have that new checkbook,"
sad," open that new bank account, drive the new car and see the new refrigerator"
sad," cause you can take those things out of the war.  But you got to know, when you drive that car that it came out of the love that a man can have for a man and you got to be a little bit better because of that."
sad, Otherwise what you have is loot and there's blood on it.
sad, And I didn't want to take any of it and I guess that included you.
sad, And you still feel that way?
sad," that includes me too, I mean and the money, you have right to that money.  Your father put planes up in the air, good planes and he deserves it, you should be proud of that.  A man should be paid for that."
hap, Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you.
hap, What am I going to do with a fortune?
hap, Buy some hats?
hap," Hey, what time is it?  This pokes around midnight right?  God this is great isn't it?"
hap, Look at the night we got.  I wouldn't trade this for anything.
hap, You know actually I wanted to go a little further up the coast and get away from all the lights and people but I was afraid you'd miss it.  How are you doing?
hap," Is that, is that, nah, is that just Paul?  I can't even tell."
hap," But if I can't tell, it probably isn't them isn't it?  Probably would be unmistakable wouldn't you think?  How are you doing?"
hap," Oh, you know what I forgot?  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I should've brought my flashlight."
neu, Yes.
hap," God.  Oh, you know what would be good right about now?  A six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the ticket."
hap," I'm so stupid, I should've brought a six-pack.  God, I'm like a little kid.  It's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped up. Oh- [LAUGHTER]"
hap, I wonder if they can hear us talk?  Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?
neu, Do you want my jacket?
hap," Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  It only happens once a year.  I mean think about the people in Kansas, they would have to get hotel reservations and plane tickets to come and see this.  We're only forty minutes away.  This is too good to pass up."
hap," Well this is like the highlight, the one night of their lives and that flopping around, that's laying eggs or spawning or mating or whatever you call it."
hap," But this is the big night for these guys.  Their last, life's last orgy."
hap, Yeah they do.
hap," Okay.  But it's fish that do something that no other fish do.  Like the swallows in Capistrano or the Lemmings that throw themselves off the cliffs, there's magic here and some mystery and a little bit of unexplainable."
neu, I'm just not.
hap," Look, is that...no is that just seaweed?"
hap," You know, this is great isn't it?  You know, I wouldn't trade this for anything."
hap," I mean, think about this, I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute."
hap," Somewhere out there, there's this huge silver mass of fish heading this way, they don't why, we don't know why, they just some little instinctual fire cracker went off in their bodies..."
hap," ...like and they all just turned at once and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming this way.  They didn't, you know, they didn't make a decision, they didn't, you know, have boats or anything.  No one sent them an invitation or a map, they just started swimming as if that's the only thing that matters."
hap," It's single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge and they don't, they don't ask it a question, they don't give it a name, they just swim."
hap, They just start swimming to this place right here where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death.
hap," Oh, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are standing up."
hap, [BREATHING] So what do you think?
hap, About what I just said?
hap, So what do you think?
ang, About what?
ang, It's ridiculous.
ang," It's PR.  I mean, somebody sold you a good bill about this wonderful event that going to happen on the beach."
ang," Yeah.  Everyone else was sold the same thing.  I mean, look, it keeps us excited, it keeps us coming back for more and you know, keeps us thinking life's going to start any minute now."
ang," Look, I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me."
ang, Okay.  Twice is as many times as we've tried and that's ever.
ang," Augie, god dammit, don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting."
ang," Listen, I've waiting my entire life on this beach just standing there waiting for this fish to show up and these fish never show up."
neu," Well, we're going to see it."
ang," No we won't.  I mean, God, this isn't about the fish Augie."
neu," Let's see I took a shower, you were watching the news, you said hey, hey the Grunions are running tonight and I said great let's go, I feel lucky tonight."
sad, We thought I was pregnant.
neu, Wait a minute.  I've got it.
neu, It was in the car right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker...
neu, And you said let's get some champagne and I said time's a wasting or something like that.
neu, You want this to be like the other time right?  That's it right?
sad, I'd rather not remember something...
sad, Rather not hope for something.
sad, No.
ang, I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be.
ang, Welcome to the human race.
ang, Do you think that this is what I had in mind?  That four years down the line that we'd get married and come to the beach and argue with each other over fish?  No.
ang, I was just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great and the sand in our toes and the wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'd have three big fat rosy kids...
ang, ...and you know?  Baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get?  Do you know what you get Carla?  You get this.
ang, Yes it is.
ang, Right.
ang, Cause everything isn't anything like I thought it would be.
sad, This is just this.  You know?  I mean it's a lot and everything but it isn't somewhere else.  Do you know what I'm trying to say?
sad, I know you are Augie.  I know you wanted this evening to be nice.
sad, I can't help thinking about being somewhere else.
sad, Maybe if you were with someone else too.
sad, I didn't say that.
sad, I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.
sad," Augie, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing with you."
sad, If anybody wants to be with anybody else it's probably you.  Probably somebody who enjoys herself a little more and is not so hard.
sad," Well, I guess this is the wrong spot for the right people."
hap, I mean look at the view of the moon we got from here.
hap, Yeah.  I noticed that.  It's real pretty on the water.
hap," Hey, look what we got here."
hap, Oh you brought refreshments.
hap, No I'm beginning to think you might be right.
hap, I think this may be the place for us after all.
hap, I am sorry Augie.
hap, Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come.
hap, Or not.
hap, Or not.
hap, Now and always sweet.
hap, I don't care then.
hap," I mean, it was, it's bound to come out sooner or later."
hap, That sent shivers up my spine.
hap," No, wrong number."
hap, Behave exquisitely.
sad, That's serious enough.
neu, I didn't hit you very hard.
neu, Yes.  The real cause of that rile was Peter Burden.
neu," Oh, come on, you knew there was nothing in that."
ang, Presents?  A trivial little broach.
ang, You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
neu, No I didn't.  You made up the whole thing in your jealous imagination.
ang, You must admit he was in love with you.
neu, Just a little perhaps but nothing serious.
ang, You let him kiss you. You said so.  What of it?
neu," Well it didn't harm him, in fact, it pleasured him a lot and it didn't hurt me."
ang, And what about me?
ang," Oh, that's a nice point of view I must say."
ang," Yeah, so am I.  Bored stiff."
neu, You want some brandy?
neu, I'll have a little I think.
ang, I don't know why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.
ang, No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones.
ang, I don't see what you have to go on and on with this kind of thing.
ang, Oh my...just because I just...okay...
neu, It's become a habit with you.
ang, You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.
ang, What?
neu," No, just making myself beautiful for you."
neu, That's the woman's job to lure the man.  Watch me a moment won't you?
neu, Actually that's perfectly true.
neu, Yes it is.
neu, I think that
ang," Adders don't snap, they sting."
ang, They sting.
ang, Mind your business.
ang, You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk.
ang, I'm not in the least bit drunk.
ang, You've always had a weak head.
ang," Okay, like I mentioned before I had three very small, minute liquor glasses of brandy.  That's not even enough to get a child of two drunk."
ang," On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk off just one glass of brandy."
ang," Oh, what an interesting topic.  What about a child of four and a child of six?  A child of nine?"
ang, Shut up.
ang, We might be able to bring up a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots.
ang," Not very funny dear.  In fact, maybe you better have some more brandy."
ang," Oh, thanks.  I think I will."
ang, You better turn that off.
neu, They are away in Tunis.
ang, No I'll do no such thing.
ang, Very well.  If you insist on being a boorish and idiotic.
ang," Come on, turn it off.  It's driving me mad."
ang, You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.
ang, Turn it--Turn it off.
ang, Go away.  Go away.  I hate you.
ang, Very amusing indeed.
ang," I hate you.  Listen I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully."
ang," You know what?  You're a vile, little, evil-minded, little, wicked beast and I never want to see you again."
ang," This is the end.  Understand?  This is the end, here and now, forever and always."
ang, You're not going nowhere. No you're not.
ang," Oh, yes I am. Yes I am and you can't stop me."
ang, Just shut up.
ang, shut up. shut up.  I would-I would never marry you again if you came crawling back to me on your hands and knees because you're an evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never see you again.
ang," Listen, you're a cruel fiend and I hate, loathe you.  Thank God finally, finally thank God I've realized just how horrible you are--and marry you?  Marry you?  Never. I will never marry you.  I will die die in torment-"
ang, Beast. Brute. Cad. Swine. Beast. Beast. Brute. Devil. Sorry.
ang, Oh.
