neu," Hi. Excuse me.  Um, I'd like to put in this application for my registration."
neu, Hi.
neu," Okay.  Let me see here.  Um, we need--we need your original birth certificate."
neu, Right.  Well.  We still need it.

ang," You know, Official documentation--"
ang," Yeah, but your birth certificate--I mean, who carries around their birth certificate?  Nobody does that."
ang, With your driver's license and your passport.  Just like everybody else.
ang," Who--you always use your driver's license.  I mean, you're not coming to the D.M.V. if you're not over sixteen and that's when you get your driver's license so you're never gonna need it anyway."
sad, It's almost time for me to go.

hap," It'll be good.  Wow, that's great."
hap," Oh, thank you. [LAUGHTER]"
neu," So, uh, so how's it been going?  I mean, you have any needs or anything?"
neu," No.  You can't think that way.  I mean it's good--it's good that you're--that you're calling, you know. you can't"
neu," No, come on.  Don't [GARBAGE]"
neu," I know.  I know. It's hard, but you just--you gotta keep going.  I mean, you've been going at it for so long, you know.  Something is definitely going to come up.  I-I know it will, because you're a good worker--"
neu," No.  It's--I mean, it's competitive, you know.  That's-That's what it is.  that's what you gotta be is competitive."
neu," There...There are plenty of people out there with--with like, good jobs, you know, that are a lot..."
neu, ...dumber than you.  I mean they're a lot worse off than you.  You are much better off than like a lot of those people in there. I know
neu," I know.  It makes it harder.  I mean it's definitely who you know in a lot of cases, but--"
neu," But you gotta.  Otherwise, what is--what's your other option?"
sad, I feel so worthless.
neu," It's not worthless 'cause it's definitely gonna--it's definitely gonna pay off.  I know it.  I mean, I can--I've just--I've seen your work etiquette.  You know, you're a good worker and..."
neu, ... and there's no reason that--that something won't come up like really soon.  All right?  So you just gotta--
neu," Because I know you.  You know, and maybe once you get to know some more people, like talking to them and everything, they'll get to know you too and they'll realize they should've hired you three years ago.  You know? but  And- and they'll finally come around and believe me--it'll--you gotta-"
neu," Well maybe yeah, but maybe you get to that point where it's like you bug 'em and then they just don't wanna hear from you anymore, but you keep bugging them and bugging them and then it's gonna annoy them so much that they're gonna be like all right fine. you know"
neu," That obviously that's not true though.  I mean, you've done this before.  You've done all the work like this before, you know, and and you've gotten people saying oh, you're so good and like you know--"
neu, Right.
neu," Well, you've gotta live."
neu," I mean, it's just, it's really--I don't know, yeah, it's about their opinions and it's about, I don't know, just getting yourself out there and--"
sad," I just wanna crawl in a hole, you know.  Like it just makes you not wanna even open your eyes in the morning."
neu," Well, come on, come on.  Thinking about it like this is definitely not gonna help either though."
neu," Hi, um, excuse me, I believe that the airline lost my baggage."
neu," Um, okay, it didn't--didn't come out on the carrousel--"
neu," No, it didn't. um It didn't come out and I don't see it anywhere around here, so what can you do about that?"
neu," Okay.  Um, well, unfortunately yeah there was a some- some problems with the--"
neu," Uh, well some-some of the bags were--were lost on the way over here. uh-"
neu," You know, I mean, there's a lot of things that go on under the plane and sometimes, you know, that kind of things happen."
neu," Uh, But, we are willing to reimburse you for the bag and and for the contents--"
neu, How much?
neu," Um, we'd be willing to give you uh fifty dollars for--"
neu," Right.  Uh We realize, you know, that that it's a bad situation, but I'm sorry, there's nothing that we can really do."
ang," That's all, that's all, that's all you're going to do is just give me fifty dollars and say go have fun on your vacation without any of your stuff?"
neu," I think, um, maybe you can file a claim if you want and turn it in to our main office--"
neu," Right.  No.  I mean they- they might--they might--if you-if you are argue the case more, maybe they'll reimburse you more, but, right now--"
neu," Yes, I know. I know-. It's It's frustrating.  Unfortunately though-- um"
ang," Because you don't seem to care very much, you know."
neu," By checking your bags, you--you, you know- admit to the liability that's- that's at risk--"
neu," Right, well, by checking in your bags, you agreed to, you know, at the will of the--"
neu," You paid for the flight and then your bags were checked at--it's a service that the airline provides for us.  So so, really, it's really the risk was taken and, I'm sorry, but there's really nothing else we can do.  So do you want--do you want the reimbursement?"
neu," Well, there are-there are some shops here in- in the airport--"
neu," No, um, like I said you can file a claim and, uh, maybe get reimbursed for more-- you"
neu, probably even talk to--
neu," Right, that--that gets taken care of-- That gets taken care of.  We get we do, you know, we investigate those and just make sure that um- they're not doing their own thing with them so--uh"
neu, but Unfortunately sometimes is--
neu," Well, that's--that's what I'm saying--"
neu," Okay.  Well that that could be something that you put on on the claim--on on the complaint form if you want.  And provide us with your information while you're here and then, maybe, if it turns up, then we'll send it right over."
ang, It sounds like it's such a little like oh well no big deal whatever.  It's a big deal to me.
neu," All right, Miss, I-I know.  I realize this. But Like I said, there are several people that are in your same situation, so, um, it's not--it's not totally uncommon and I'm actually gonna have to ask you to move so I can help the next person."
neu," Yes, all right.  There you go, now you can file a claim over to the left--And they'll help you out."
neu," Hey, a what's up?"
sad," Um, Johnny died yesterday."
neu," Wow, that's horrible."
neu, I'm sorry to hear about that.
sad," We knew that it was coming, but--"
neu, Yeah.
sad," It seemed like he had a little bit longer.  Like just last week, he was doing was so well."
neu," I mean, you know, at least he's not in anymore pain now, right?"
sad, Yeah.
neu," It's good, you know.  you know It hurts I know.  I know what it's like to lose someone like that."
sad, I just don't want him to be gone.
neu, It's okay.
neu," 'Cause, you know, you've got all the times that you guys did spend together, you know and that's something good that you can look back on."
neu, I mean--I don't know.
sad, And his whole family was there.
sad," I mean, he was like really conscious right up until the end. you know"
neu," Well, that's that's good, you know.  At least, I don't know.  I mean it's- it's better to go- to goout that way than..."
neu," .than you know, in pain and like this gradual, this horrible process.  I mean--"
sad," He was so young, you know.  And all the stories he used to tell me about..."
sad, ...the way he wanted to live and he was gonna go to Africa and he was gonna--
neu," But look at the--he--look at the life he did get to lead.  I mean, for his age, he'd done so much and--"
sad, Nobody's ever gonna forget him.
neu," Yeah, exactly.  He's made a big impact on a lot of people. and"
neu," And you'll always have that and--you should feel, you know, happy for him that he got to do so much before--I mean, and even after he found out last year.  I mean--"
sad, He did a lot.  But--
neu," I know.  It doesn't bring him back, but--"
neu," But It's okay because now, you know, you'll just go on with your life and--"
sad, I'm gonna forget him.
neu," No, you'll never forget him."
sad, I won't be able to hear his voice or his--
neu, I know. but you're not  I mean you're not going to forget him.  The pain will go away eventually and--or it will subside--
sad, You start to lose like that image after a while.
neu," That will be, It'll be--it'll be better that way. I mean Time will tell.  Time heals, you know, and it's good.  It's okay.  I mean, it wasn't anybody's fault or anything like that so ."
neu," It's hard to lose someone that way, but he's he's better--he's better off now."
sad, Thanks.
neu," So, how's it going?"
hap," Oh, you got what?  Where?"
hap, I got into U.S.C.
hap," Oh, no way."
hap," Yeah, I'm so excited.  So I'm gonna say--"
hap, Are you gonna go? you gonna-
hap," Yeah, I think, I mean because where else would I gonna go?  Like the other places that I applied to I really didn't like that much anyway."
hap, So--
hap," Wow, that's..."
hap," ...that's first choice, huh? That's so awesome and now look you're gonna be--you're gonna be here. you know"
hap," Yeah, I know."
hap, Absolutely. I'm so excited.
hap," I know.  I know. And we'll all get to hang out.  And I'm--even though we'll be at like at different parts of the city, we can still, like..."
hap," ...hang out and, like, have our different lives--And meet each other's friends and stuff.  So, I'm just so glad 'cause they have such a good school"
hap," Yeah, no, definitely--It's gonna.."
hap, Yeah.
hap," and like-- The football team--And like all the-...you- what I mean, like..."
hap, Yeah
hap, Fight on.
hap," You can walk somewhere and be anywhere in the country and be like, oh, yeah, I am at U.S.C."
hap," And you know what, you know what I mean, like it's recognizable rather than just being like I went some random school. It's like people really know what you..."
hap, [LAUGHTER]
hap, Wow. That's cool.
hap," ...like, they feel like--I feel like it's going to be so like accomplished.  Do you know what I mean?"
hap, Like it has some prestige. so
hap," Yeah, I mean there's all the money stuff and my mom's helping me with the financial aid and stuff.  But, it'll be fine--"
hap," Like, now that I'm accepted, it's just, like, such a huge load off my mind."
hap, I don't mind worrying about all the paperwork.  You know--
neu, So...
hap," Because, I don't have to like make that decision anymore.  I don't have to try and decide, like, what the bad school I'm going to go to is. you know"
hap," Right.  Right.  Right. Oh, man, then you're going to have to do orientation, I guess."
hap," I know. I know.  I think you go and you like stay for a couple of days and you meet people and--And they'll give you like a tour--And show you everything.  Oh, man, I'm just so--I'm so excited."
hap, That'll be awesome.
hap," I mean because you went to the campus before, right?"
hap," Yeah, oh totally.  It's a beautiful campus.  It's gonna be really nice.  Um, and everyone is friendly and like there's ivy on all the walls.  Oh, it's just so--it's so like collegiate."
hap," You know what I mean?  Like, it's like exactly what I want."
hap," Well, you know, I've thought about it but they have so many things that I might--Like try some things out first..."
hap," ...because also on the list of their, um, like G.E.'s or whatever, you have a lot of choices within every single one.  So you can, like, try things out and not just be like, oh, I have to take math, oh, I have to take this.  You know what I mean?"
hap," So, um, so I don't know."
hap, I mean I'm gonna take a bunch of stuff and see.
hap, Oh man.
hap," I- They have like--they just have so many like prestigious like this school is top ten and like the departments within it, you know what I mean."
hap," I know, I get to be one of those now--I'll like walk around and be like a U.S.C..  You know what I mean."
hap, Ahh. Yeah. [GARBAGE]
hap," You'll be like are you a fan or a student you know? Student. [LAUGHTER] Oh man, that's awesome."
hap, And you'll be like...
hap," Student. I'm a student. Yes I am, Thank you very much."
hap, [BREATHING]
hap, A U.S.C. graduate now. You're set.
hap, I know.  I'm excited.
hap," Well, that'll take a while. [GARBAGE]"
hap, That's going to be a lot of work.
hap," But, it'll be fine, I mean.  I'm so excited. It's going to be so fun."
hap," I know, and I mean the area's not great, but like the school makes up for it. It'll be fine. It'll be good."
hap, You're getting close to the beach.  I mean geez.
hap, I know. I know. So fun.  I can't wait.
hap, I will. I will. Thank you.
hap, Thanks.
neu," Hi, my name is Shiloh, welcome to--Airline Six.  Hi, how may I help you?"
neu," All right, sir."
neu, I completely understand.  Automated systems are very difficult sometimes.
neu, Okay.
neu," Um, how may I help you.  You're trying to book a specific flight?"
neu," Oh, yeah, absolutely.  You know, and especially because you've been waiting so long and I know that, um, you've been having a difficult time."
neu," I want to definitely give you our special package today, which um is usually only for valued customers who have a record of having previous,"
neu," um lots of purchases, but we're gonna go ahead and give that to you anyway. uh,  Just to make sure that you're happy with your service here."
neu, You- You can do that--You can do that now? I don't have to get like transferred through or anything like that.
neu, Is that all right?
neu," I can do that right now for you. No, absolutely.  I can take care of you all the way through to the end."
neu, All I'm going to need is your credit card number but just give me one moment. So-
neu, [BREATHING] that's good.
neu," um, you're scheduling a flight as well--And you would like to, um, we have a highly discounted hotel rate that goes along with that so that everything is all in one deal.  You're taken care of by the time that you get there."
neu," All right.  I want to make sure it's like a nice hotel--I mean-mean I'm gonna be paying a lot of money for this so I don't wanna-I don't wanna, you know, I don't wanna to be a waste of time."
neu, Absolutely. we we
neu," Yes, I completely understand.  Actually, our-our airline only uses five star hotel and above.  Except we charge at a three star hotel rate because, as a corporation, we are able to get a deal from the hotels themselves."
neu," So, you will absolutely be in a high rated great hotel and we can make sure that it's in a area of town that you like as well."
neu, Okay. So--
neu, Yeah.
neu," Well, you know, we wanted to--we wanted to go to Maui and--That was a"
neu, Okay.
neu," --you know, the kids wanna go to the beach and stuff and so--um"
neu, Great.  How many seats?
neu," Well, it's gonna be four of them."
neu, Okay.  Great.  Four seats.  I'll book you for four seats.
neu, All right.  And can they like all get together?
neu," Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Um- Would you like window seats or aisles?"
neu," Um- You know, window is nice. I guess"
neu," Okay, I can do um- a win- -two like a window and a aisle and a window and an aisle next to each other so that each of you can sit two by two. And switch around maybe?"
neu, Okay.  Great.  What time of the day would you like?
neu," Uh, well, yeah, I think we were just--you know, whenever best available, I guess.  You know--"
neu, All right.  Great.  Well we have a very open flight that leaves at nine a.m. and fortunately uh the time change actually goes um backwards from that.
neu," So, it's a five hour flight, but you'll arrive only at eleven a clock in the morning.  So that day, you can have plenty of time to get to your hotel--Rest up and then still have a nice afternoon your first afternoon in Maui."
neu," And, like, there's there's shuttles or something that I can get to the hotel."
neu, Absolutely.  That actually goes in on the same package with our hotel.  You just give me your address.  We'll come and pick up a time that allows you to get to your flight with plenty of time to spare.
neu, And a there will also be a shuttle waiting for you to take you to the appropriate hotel.
neu, Yeah--I completely understand.  It's a difficult process sometimes and we want to make traveling as easy as possible.
neu, All right.  So we're confirmed then or do you--All right.
neu, Absolutely. Thank you so much for calling and we hope that you will come to us again.
neu, Okay.
neu, Thank you.
sad, Did you talk to him?
sad, He cried hard?
sad, What was he doing out here at that hour?
ang, Why shouldn't he dream of him and walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had hope for years now?
ang," For God sakes, it's been three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane."
sad," I've got an idea, but what's the story?"
neu, I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
neu," Well, that's only your business, Chris."
ang, What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.
ang," Well, then it isn't just my business--"
neu, I'm just saying that--
ang, She's not Larry's girl.
neu, You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that.
ang, To hell with that.
neu, [BREATHING] Have you asked Annie yet?
neu," Well, how do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way your father does."
sad," Well, if she does, then that's the end of it.  But from her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.  And then we'll thrash it out with Dad, right?  Mom, don't avoid me."
sad," Trouble is, you don't see enough women."
neu, Because it is.
ang, Are you crazy?
ang, I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.
ang, What about the business?  What the hell is this?
ang, The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
ang, Must you be inspired?
ang," Yes.  I like it an hour a day.  If I'm gonna grub for my money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful."
neu," Yes, on this I would."
ang," Well, you don't want to think like that."
neu, I am thinkin' that way.
neu," No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy."
sad, I can see that.
neu," Well, maybe he just wanted to see her again."
neu, What do you mean?  He lived next door to the girl all his life.  Why wouldn't he want to see her again?
neu, How do you know he's even thinking of it?
ang, It's got that all about it.
neu," Well, so what?"
neu," Now, listen Kate."
neu, You can't read her mind.
neu, How do you know why she's waited?
ang," Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  I mean, laugh--laugh at me, but..."
ang, But why did that happen the very night she came here?  She sleeps in his room and his memorial breaks to pieces.  Just look.  Look at it.
ang, What does that mean?  Me above all?
ang, Look at you.  Look at you shaking.
ang, What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you Kate?
neu, You're not sorry you came?
sad," from her point of view, why else would I come?"
hap," You feel it's wrong here, don't you?  This yard, this chair.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to have to win you away from anything."
hap, I almost got married two years ago.
hap, You started to write me and--
hap, Every day since.
hap, I will never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I did was sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.
sad, No.  Nothing like that.
sad," Then, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed."
sad," Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me."
sad, You've gotta tell me.
sad, I don't know how to start.
sad, It wouldn't work this way.
sad," It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?"
sad," Yeah, sure."
sad," Well, I lost them."
sad, How many?
sad, Just about all.
sad," Oh, gee."
sad, It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.
sad," For instance, one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had."
sad," They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today."
sad," I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that there was one new thing being made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man."
sad," You know what I mean?  To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him."
sad, Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.
sad," And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator."
sad," I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it."
sad, Because otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of it.  And I guess that included you.
sad, You still feel that way?
hap, What'll I do with a fortune?
hap, What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.
hap," This is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here, couldn't be better."
hap," I would have liked to have gone a little further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it."
hap, How you doing?
hap, Is that--no--is that just foam?  I can't even tell.
hap," Well, I guess we can tell, it probably isn't right?  Probably be unmistakable don't you think?"
hap," How you doing?  Aw, you know what I forgot?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  Oh, how could I be so stupid?  I should've brought my flashlight."
neu, What flashlight?
neu," Oh, well sure."
neu," Right, of course.  Our flashlight.  Mine and yours.  I mean, me flashlight is su flashlight naturally."
neu," I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Do you remember?"
neu, Yeah.
neu," You cold?  Do you want my jacket?  Oh, we should've brought the blanket.  Our blanket."
hap," This is great, isn't it?  A six pack would be just the ticket right now."
hap, I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.
hap, You think they can hear us talk?  Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?
neu, Do you want my jacket?
neu, Right.
neu, That's my point too.
neu, No. No. That's not my point.  The point is there's no point in coming down if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?
hap," Think about the people in Kansas, they had to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to see this.  We live forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up."
hap," Yeah, but that moment on the beach, is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping is laying eggs or what do you--spawning or mating.  I mean,"
hap, this is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy.
hap, Alright.  But it's fish that do something that none of the other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs.
neu," I don't get it.  The first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life."
neu, We weren't in a good spot.
neu, We didn't see them the first time either.
hap, There is that--no that's just seaweed isn't it?
hap," Oh man, this is great, isn't it?  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  Here, think about this, all right, I know you're not interested, but think about this."
hap," all as one, this time release instinctual little firecracker went off and they all turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.  And they're swimming right now as if that's all that matters."
hap, It's like single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge.  They don't know what drives them.  They don't ask it a question or give it a name.
hap," They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them right here to where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death."
hap," Ah, God, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are popped up."
neu," Well, so what do you think?"
neu, About what?
neu, What I was saying.
hap," Well, so what do you think?"
neu, About what?
neu, What I was saying.
neu, It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.
neu," Well, I'm not the only one.  Look at all these people."
neu," Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period?"
ang," God damn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting."
ang, We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.
neu," There's nothing to it.  We come here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home. We go home."
neu, We've missed them twice.  That's not ever.
neu," Well, we'll see them this year."
ang," I mean, I feel like my whole life is gonna be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up.  And the fish won't show up."
neu, It's just fish.  Nothing to get traumatized about.
neu," You said, ""Hey the grunion are running tonight.""  I said, ""Great, let's go.  I feel lucky."""
neu," Okay, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage--"
sad," Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago, right after we got married."
sad," I thought I was pregnant, you had a bottle of champagne, but no glasses.  You asked me to dance, so we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork."
sad," And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them."
sad," And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, at last--at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be."
neu, Wait a minute.  I've got it.
sad," Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle."
neu," It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, ""let's get some champagne,"" and I said, ""time's a wasting"" or something like that, right?"
neu," Yeah, of course, I see it now.  You want this to be like that other time, right?  That's it, right?"
sad, I'd rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.
neu," Okay, yeah, sure, I see it now.  Listen, you wanna dance?"
sad, No.
neu, You want me to go get some champagne?
sad, No.
neu, Take off our shoes?
sad, No.
ang," Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed?  That four years down the road, we'd be at the beach yelling at each other over fish?"
sad," No, Carla, I'm just like you.  I thought it was gonna be all peaches and roses and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us"
neu," Yes, it is."
neu, Right.
sad, Well.  This isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.
sad," I know, me neither."
sad, I'm doing the best I can.
sad," I know that, Augie.  Really, I do."
sad," I know that you meant this to be special and nice and the sand and the moon and all, but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else."
sad, Maybe if you were with somebody else too.
sad, I didn't say that.
sad," No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy."
sad, You're the one who probably wishes you were with someone else.  Someone who--you'd rather enjoy yourself and didn't take everything so hard.
hap," I don't know.  It seemed like a pretty good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you have of the moon from here."
hap," Well, look what we have here."
hap," Augie, you brought refreshments."
hap, It's not champagne.
hap," Well, then we don't need glasses."
hap, No.  I think you might be right.  Maybe this is the spot after all.
sad," Augie, I'm sorry."
hap, Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come.
hap, Or not.
hap, Or not.
neu, I wonder.
neu, I don't care then.
neu, Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number.
hap," Ah, it send shivers up my spine."
hap, Behave exquisitely.
neu, With the most perfect poise?
hap," Oh, of course.  I shall probably do a court curtsy."
neu, Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they?
hap, What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.
neu," Oh, darling, don't say that."
hap, It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.
neu," Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?"
hap," Yes, meaning just that."
neu," You mustn't be serious, my dear one.  That's just what they want."
neu, Who's they?
neu, All those futile moralists that try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.
neu, Flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.
neu," If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too."
neu," Certainly, you must.  We're figures of fun, alright."
neu," Well how long will it last us, this ludicrous overbearing love of ours."
neu, Who knows.
neu," Well, shall we always want to bicker and fight?"
neu," No, that desire will fade.  Along with our passion."
neu," Oh, dear, shall we like that?"
neu, Depends on how well we've played.
neu," Well, what happens if one of us dies?  I mean, does the one that's left still laugh?"
hap, Yes.  Yes. With all his might.
hap," No. No, it isn't.  Death is very laughable.  Such a cunning little mystery.  All done with mirrors."
hap," Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense."
neu, So is everyone else in the long run.
hap," Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can.  Like quite idiotic, very small school children.  Let's savor the delight of the moment."
hap," Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets."
hap," Elliott, worms don't pop."
neu," I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint yourself green and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as you love me best."
hap," Oh, thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you."
neu, You remember that awful scene we had in Venice?
hap, Which particular one?
neu, The one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it on my bed.
hap, Charles.  That was his name.  Charles.  He did wriggle so beautifully.
hap," Yes, I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that."
neu, How long did that row last?
hap, It went in intermittently for days.
neu, The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.
hap, It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.
neu, That was the first time you ever hit me.
neu, I didn't hit you very hard.
hap," The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers."
hap," Oh, I'll never forget his face."
hap, It was ridiculous.  Completely ridiculous.
neu, We were very much younger then.
neu," As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden."
neu," As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden."
neu, I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.
ang, What of it?
ang," Well, what about me?"
neu," Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey, you never would have known a thing about it."
neu," Me, too.  Bored stiff.  You want some brandy?"
neu, No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones.
neu, Just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.
neu," Well, it's become a habit with you."
ang," You needn't be so grand, just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment."
ang, Don't be so stupid.
ang, What?
hap," A woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute, will you?"
ang," Oh, be quiet."
ang," Adders don't snap, they sting."
ang, You're quite insufferable
ang, I'm not in the least drunk.
ang, Shut up.
ang," We could get a good debate going about this, don't you think?  Intemperate tots."
ang, Why?
ang," Turn it on again, please."
ang, I'll do no such thing.
ang," Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic."
ang, Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.
ang, You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.
ang, Turn it off.
ang, Stop it.  Go away.  I hate you.
ang," Amanda, listen. listen"
ang," Listen?  Listen, indeed.  I am sick and tired of listening to you, damn sadistic bully."
ang," I hate you.  Stop it.  Stop it.  I hate you, do you hear?  You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible."
ang," You're a vile, tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I hope to never see you again as long as I live."
ang, This is the end.  Finally and forever.  Do you hear me?  The end.
ang, You're not going like this.
ang," Oh Yes, I am."
ang, You're not.
ang, I am.  Let go of me.  You're a cruel fiend and I hate and loathe you.
ang, Shut up. Shut up.
ang, I wouldn't-- I wouldn't marry--
ang, I wouldn't marry you if you came in crawling on your knees
ang, Thank God I realized what you are-- I'd never marry you again ever in my life. You're a cruel fiend and I hate you. You're a beast. You're a beast--I hate you. Stop it.  Stop it.
ang, You're a evil vampire and I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live.
neu," Hi, How can I help you?"
neu," Yea. I just want to get this done,"
neu," Sure, um"
neu, get my new license.
neu, do you have two forms of ID with you?
neu," Um, no, I got my driver's license though."
neu," I actually need two forms of ID. I need either a passport or a birth certificate, or social security card. I'm sorry."
neu," Uh, sorry, I forgot them. I mean I've got to -"
neu, Well
neu, well is the dri-driver's license going to work?
neu, I- I can take your driver's license but I need another form of ID in order to process this paper work.
neu," Um, that you would need to go home and get another form of ID and come back."
ang," What? I- You telling me I waited in that huge line to go and sit down and get my number called, like after"
ang, three hours and
ang, Shouldn't they have like told us about that? I mean why - why would they make me go and wait three hours if I have got to go and do it again?
ang," It's standard? I mean I don't work at the D.M.V. how am I supposed to know that, like, I stand in line, I get my"
ang," I filled out the application right, didn't I?"
neu," I'm sorry, sir."
neu, there is nothing I can do.
ang, You- shouldn't you have like a sign or something maybe like up on the counter when you get the applica- maybe on the application
ang," What web- I didn't go to a website - why would I need to - it's the D.M.V.. You come to the D.M.V., you wait in line for three hours, and then you go home."
sad, I don't want you to go.
sad," I know, I know. I don't want to go either baby. I love you know. And I'm going to miss you a lot."
sad," I'm going to miss you too; I don't know what I'm going to do here without you. It's going to be so lonely, and so hard."
sad, I don't want to be a single mom.
sad," You won't be. I'll be back; I'll be back before you know it. All right, and"
sad, but
sad, and
sad, It's dangerous; I mean how can you make sure that you'll
sad, I hope so.
sad, I hope so.
sad, It's going to be really rough.
sad," You gotta take care of our baby for me, alright?"
sad, I'll send you lots of pictures.
sad," I hope so, because I'm not going to be able to survive without all that. I don't know what I'm going to do."
sad, I've never been - I've never been away from you for two weeks let alone a year.
sad," Well, just promise me that you going to be safe."
sad," I mean can't they put you in like, you know kitchen work or something where you won't get"
sad, there's people that thought it was the right thing to do so now we have to- we have to do what we have to do for our country
neu," and it'll work out you know, go there and do that. Yeah, I'll be back"
sad," Will you write me letters, paper ones?"
sad," Our baby needs a dad; you can't leave. Okay, you can't disappear."
sad," Our baby has a dad, alright. Daddy is going to be back soon."
sad," I want you to, you know, take lots of video; pictures and I can see you when I get back or while I'm there. I'm going to miss you."
sad, I'll miss you too.
hap," Oh, you're never going to believe it."
hap, What? What? You look really happy what's going on?
hap," Well, I finally did it"
hap, Finally did what?
hap," Oh, my Gosh. Well, and did"
hap, Did she say yes?
hap," Yes, she said yes. [LAUGHTER] I know"
hap, That's like the most definitive.
hap, I would have thought you would have told me that you were planning on doing this.
hap," Yea, I guess so. Oh, my Gosh. Was she surprised?"
hap," Yes, yes. You know, she - she was like - I mean, she was happy, you know"
hap," I - I think it was about time, I don't know, maybe. You know what, it's been it's been long enough now."
hap," Oh, well, it was -- you know, we were at this- at this concert and yeah"
hap, so I-I talked to some of the crew before hand and-
hap," Oh, You did not."
hap, I-I did.
hap," Oh, my Gosh. that's so cute"
hap," That's so romantic. Oh, my Gosh. She must have died. That's like one of those things you write into a magazine about like my boyfriend did this. Oh my God."
hap," I know, so"
hap, I got to freak her out.
hap," No, yes -- so"
hap, She must have flipped out.
hap," Yea, that way she was guaranteed that she could not say no."
hap, Right exactly because you can't say no in front of thousands of people. [LAUGHTER]
hap," No, but it was good."
hap, Did you bring her up on stage too?
hap," Yes, yes. [LAUGHTER]"
hap," Oh, my Gosh, that's so cute."
hap," I know it was, I don't know I was really nervous but I'm really - I'm really glad."
hap, Are your parents excited or...?
hap," Oh yes, they - they you know they love her and so I mean..."
hap," Ooh, that would be fun."
hap," Yea, yea, I'm not too sure where yet I guess you know, I kind of got to figure some stuff out here first"
hap," Oh my Gosh. I cannot believe you're getting married, that is so cool."
hap, I know.
hap," Golly, it just makes me all like romantic inside, like I really want that to happen to me. [LAUGHTER]"
hap," Oh, it will, obviously you know. But I know it's something - I don't know, you never really think about it happening, like before hand."
hap," Sure. Oh, yes."
hap," Yes, well, Thanks, thanks. Thank you. yeah"
hap," Yay, well congratulations, that's so cool. [BREATHING] I can't wait."
hap, Hah.
neu, So how you feeling?
neu," You've been doing a lot of work for it, right?"
neu," Right, so the fact you doing the best that you can is -"
neu," you know you shouldn't give yourself a hard time for that, it's the best you can."
neu," Well, but you care about what you do, right?"
neu," I understand that it's so frustrating but I know that you're here because you really want it you know and, and uh"
neu," Well, I mean you're still here you've tried for this long so I think that says something all in itself."
neu, You are persistence. I mean that's important. that's
neu," Well, you're talented so keep that in mind, you know, you shouldn't give yourself too hard of a time."
sad, I'm sorry.
sad," I don't know, it's just not, I don't know - I don't know what to do really, you know, I'm just thinking"
neu," That's- I mean. There are more factors then just whether you're good or not, you know what I mean like"
neu," and the fact that you know there is always different types of things and what kind of people they want in the office and whether it's male or female or you know what I mean, like things are out of your control."
neu, So you should take that in consideration rather than giving yourself such a hard time.
ang, this doesn't happen to a normal person.
neu," You know and the fact you still here and still cooking, like it's good that you're thinking about it, that you're reconsidering."
neu," But like, just because you're considering why it's been so difficult doesn't mean you should just stop."
neu," Maybe you should take a little break from it, but I don't think you should stop."
sad, Right. Thanks for talking to me.
neu, Hi. Um-
neu," Hi, can I help you?"
neu, It seems that uh- my-my bag didn't make it out on the carousel.
neu," Oh, did you check? Did you make sure as it went around the second time that it-"
neu," Yes, yes, it's gone around like you know twenty times. It's been about a half hour."
neu," Okay. Well, um- the f."
neu," Actually I'm looking here at the information, the flight that you were on we had some trouble with some of the baggage, it looks like a few peoples' bags didn't make it through. Um, so-"
neu, Okay. So what-what do I have to get you know
neu," Well, you can fill out this paperwork um- and if for some reason it shows up, we can bring it to you, but-"
neu," Well, sometimes it's just late baggage or misplaced baggage and it comes out but it seems to be here and just I'm reading off of this that"
neu, Uh- it didn't make it into the second plane so it looks like there - they don't actually know what happened to it.
neu," Um, well, sometimes there is just difficulties with loading on to the plane. Uh- There can be a theft or uh- some sort of you know mishap with a cart or something."
neu," I- I- I understand, but um."
neu, Okay
neu, Right.
neu," I understand that. Um- So I'm going to put down here that you looking for your baggage, but we actually can't, uh this bag is likely not going to show up so what we're going to do-"
neu," Sometimes it gets stolen, sometimes it gets misplaced on another plane and"
neu," they - they, it gets shipped to somewhere else and then it's stuck somewhere and then we have no way of tracking that."
neu, So we'll- what we'll do
ang," But we have the tags on. I mean like it wouldn't you know, if it got stuck somewhere it's like well this is nobodies bag I mean maybe you know look on the tag and"
neu, Right. Like I said sometimes a theft and things happen like that but we are willing to reim-reimburse you.
neu," Um, so."
ang," Theft? Don't you know like all these people that are work - you keep like an eye on them, how can they get away with-"
neu," We have very tight security but we -uh- there are times when we just can't uh make sure there aren't absolutely no human error, you know"
neu, I'm sorry there is no guarantee on baggage.
ang, you don't realize the stuff that I've got in that - I really need to get the suitcase okay
neu," I understand, so-"
neu," all right, We've already checked back here for your baggage"
neu, and we will continue to look for it and because your paper-
neu," Well, it's- it's just sort of help with the fact uh that you lost some of your possessions and we rather do that than-"
neu, The airline can't afford to give you everything that is in that suitcase. and so-
ang, The a- what? Talking about a core they can't afford it? I mean-
neu, Well because lots of people get their baggage lost and we don't want to have false claims or anything like that so we have
neu," we can give you fifty dollar to sort of make up for it, to compensate, and we can definitely let you know if it shows up but likely, more than likely-"
ang, I mean you're not helping me here. What do I have to do here? Do I need to sue the airline company is that what I should do
sad, Kathy died last night.
sad," yeah, I mean, you know, it was a -"
sad," I guess we saw it coming and she lasted a lot - a lot longer than, uh, they expected but you know, I mean when it actually happens it's just a lot harder."
sad," It doesn't make any easier, yes."
sad," I mean at least she was home, she wasn't in the hospital anymore,"
sad," Oh, man. I'm so sorry."
sad," She was with- yeah  She was with Gary, and he said that she was just sitting there and went to sleep, closed her eyes, and that was it."
sad," It's going to be so rough, I'm sorry."
sad," Yes. I mean, it's not as rough on me as it is on him but"
sad," God, it's you know, we've spent so much time with them it's just really surreal, really weird that we're not going to be able to see her anymore and go"
sad, Yeah.
sad," out to- out to dinner you know and do the troops to California, I mean."
sad, Totally.
sad," It's just that- I don't know, it's sort it's sort- of a weird thing you know"
sad, Yeah
sad," not being able to see anyone again, who knows where they really went, you know. I mean, I guess we can just hope that wherever they are now if it's anywhere that it's better I mean."
sad," Yes. Well, at least you have a lot of good memories."
sad, She was [garbage]
sad," She really cared about you, you know."
sad," Yes, I mean she cared about all of us. She was great"
sad, so loving everybody you know.
sad, And she was
sad," Gosh, I just hate I just hate to see her go."
sad, Yeah.
sad, We were all going take a trip to Europe you know.
sad, Even if you still do she'll- she'll be there.
sad, Yes.  [BREATHING] God.
sad, Are you going to be okay?
sad," I just -- I just don't get it, like there is just nothing you can do about it you know, it's like just out of your control and it"
sad," just makes it that much harder to deal 'cause as much as you want to, you know, make her better, see her not in any pain, it's like, just I don't know, just has a mind of its own."
sad, Then she's gone.
sad," It's going to be okay, I promise."
sad," Well, you know I appreciate you coming over and talking to me, I mean it definitely helps"
sad, Sure
sad, to talk to somebody but
sad, you shouldn't be alone
sad," It's just going to take a while, I think."
sad, Yes.
sad, Ah.
sad, Thank you.
sad, Yes.
hap," Oh, yeah? Have you gotten letters yet?"
hap," Um, I don't know, where?"
hap, U.S.C..
hap," Oh my Gosh, that's so cool."
hap," [LAUGHTER] It's gotta be it, like-"
hap," Oh my Gosh, that's so cool."
hap," but big packet, big packet is nice"
hap, big packet is gotta be the real thing. yeah
hap," So it's like, yes, rip it open and there it is big - oh, yes."
hap," Oh my Gosh. I thought there was like, maybe going to be some, like I don't know if you are going to get in or not, so I'm really glad that you did."
hap, That's so cool.
hap," Yeah. I know, I know."
hap, it was you know I wasn't too sure I mean you know it was kind of last minute for like the application
hap, and everything like but

neu, All right. Customer service this is Steve.
hap," Hi. Thank you so much, you're a real person, right, you're not like a recording?"
hap," Okay. Before I get into it, um your menu or whatever like where you choose the different thing depending on the-"
hap," it leads you around in circles, you can't, there is no way to like get to a real person if you don't already know how to get to there."
neu," Right. No, yes I know. It is-It is a little frustrating."
neu," I- I'll give you a little hint, next time if it asks if you're on a rotary phone you know, just stay on the line instead of - instead of hitting one or two to say if you're like on a touch tone"
neu," pretend like your on a rotary phone, goes straight through to a person."
neu, I know they don't tell you that kind of thing.
neu," Sorry. Okay. Um-, yes"
neu," Thank you very much. Um  So I have a charge on my credit card that, um, isn't mine."
neu," Uh, I don't know where it came from and it's actually quite large, and I don't have the money for it so"
neu," Yea. All right. Well, let me-let me look it up here for a second. Uh, so i think"
neu," Okay, it was um- at the [GARBAGE] sorry, it was at a department store, I think it was Macy's or something"
neu," Okay, Alright, yeah. I- I see it on here."
neu," All right. Well, you know that's, that's what we have all of our protection plans for and everything like that so I mean it's"
neu, it- it'll work out fine.
neu," Yes, we'll get- we'll get rid of it right now. I mean just we're going to have to have you, um, submit something you know, we're going to have to have you mail something in for us, okay."
neu," So- So you can um find that application. You have the Internet, you can go to our website."
neu, Yeah. Yeah. You get the form right now. and- yeah
neu," We could mail it to you as well, but-"
neu," Right. You can go online, print it out, and just fill out the form and um- send it to us um- you know,  regarding the grievance and-"
neu, and it'll get taken off um- no problem you know
neu, Right. I mean we might
neu, Okay.
neu," Uh, I mean have you been shopping around on the Internet and stuff? I mean that you gave-"
neu, I did buy one thing on ebay I don't know that might-
neu," Uh-ha, I mean usually sites are pretty well protected but sometimes I mean information gets out, so"
neu, so it is a little a little hard in that situation if you want -- you know you can -um- we can- we can issue another credit card.
neu," Yeah, yeah. Maybe we'll, uh-"
neu, it's a different number and everything
neu, Yeah. yeah.
neu," Yes, um but  for- for that- for that charge we will need you to send something in but we can get you processed immediately for this, for this, for this new card. It still goes to the same address, right?"
neu, Okay. All right. Then we'll get it sent out there. And
hap, Great.
neu, And you know just I mean be careful in the future if um
hap, Yeah.
neu, if you're ever online or anything like that I mean just make sure it's a secure site and
neu," and never you know, give it to anyone out, never even give out your number to any like unreliable company that you haven't heard of or anything like that, all right? Because, um, we want to- we definitely want to help you out, but-"
neu," Right, right."
neu," Okay, great."
neu," Yeah, totally."
neu, you know it gets- it gets difficult you know so Alright.
hap, Well thank you so much. You've been very helpful. I really appreciate it.
neu," Alright Yes, I'm sorry for all the inconvenience but we'll get it taken care of."
hap, Thank you very much bye.
sad, I don't know. When it cracked he ran into the house and cried in the kitchen.
sad, No. I figured it was best to leave him alone.
sad, I could hear him right through the floor in my room.
ang, We've got to say it to him.
ang," For God sakes it's been three years, nobody comes back after three years, that's insane."
neu, You know why I brought Annie here don't you?
neu, You know.
neu, I got an idea but what's the story?
neu, I'm going to ask her to marry me.
neu," Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't-"
ang, See it isn't just my business-
neu, From father's point of you he isn't dead and you have no right to take his girl.
ang," I don't know why but every time I reach out for something that I really want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time after time."
neu, You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that.
ang, To hell with that.
neu, I wanted to get this settled first.
neu, How do you know she'll marry you? Maybe she feels the same way your father does.
neu," Well, if she does then that's the end of it. From her letters I think she's forgotten him."
sad," I don't know, I'll find out. Then we'll trash it out with dad, right? Mom, don't avoid me."
ang," Trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did."
ang, I just don't see why it has to be Annie.
sad," If I can't do that here well, then I'll have to get out."
ang, What the hell is this?
sad," I'll get out. I'll get married and go live some place else, maybe New York."
ang," What the hell is this, are you crazy?"
ang," I've been a good son too long a good sucker, I'm through with it."
ang, What about the business? What is this?
ang, The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
ang, Must you be inspired?
ang," Yes, I like it and hour a day. If I'm going to grub for money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful."
ang," Tell me, you'd leave the business?"
sad," Yes, on this I would."
ang," Well, you don't want to think like that."
sad," Yea, I can see that."
ang, Why did he invite her here?
ang, She's been in New York three and half years why all of a sudden-
neu," Well, maybe he just wanted to see her again."
ang, Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.
ang, He's not going to marry her.
neu, How do you know he's even thinking of it?
neu," Well, so what?"
ang, What's going on here Joe?
ang, -She's not his girl Joe; she knows she's not.
neu, You can't read her mind.
ang," I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you. Don't you think I haven't noticed since he invited her, I won't stand for any nonsense"
sad, I need you to believe with me; I can't stand all alone.
ang," What does that mean, me above all?"
ang, Look at you -- look at you shaking.
hap," I know, it went out of style, didn't it?"
hap, It's all right.  It's a good thing.
hap," You know, it's lovely here, the air is sweet."
hap," No, not sorry.  But, um. But I'm not gonna stay."
hap," I knew they would, your mother anyway."
neu," Well, from her point of view, why else would I come?"
hap, I guess this is why I came.
hap, I'm embarrassing you and I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted some place we'd never been before.  A place where we'd be brand new to each other.
hap," Well, you started to write me"
hap, You felt something that far back?
hap, Every day since.
hap," Ann, why didn't you let me know?"
sad, Let's drive someplace.  I want to be alone with you.
sad, No.  Nothing like that.
sad," Well, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed."
sad," Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me."
sad, It wouldn't work this way.
sad," Well, I lost them."
sad, Just about all.
sad, It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.
sad," For instance, this one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but those are the kind of guys I had."
sad," They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  I mean, a little more selfish and they'd have been here today."
sad," I got this idea watching 'em go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that one new thing was made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man. You know what I mean?"
sad," To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone can feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him."
sad," Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here. I mean, the whole thing to them seemed like it's sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again."
sad," And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator."
sad," I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta realize that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it."
sad, Otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of that.  And I guess that included you.
sad, Do you still feel that way?
neu, I want you now Annie.
sad," 'Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Because you have a right to everything you have, Chris.  Everything, you understand that?  Me too."
sad," I mean, and your money, there's- there's nothing wrong with your money.  I mean, your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  A man should be paid for that."
hap, What'll I do with a fortune?
hap, What time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight.
hap," God, this great, isn't it? Like look at the night we go here, it couldn't be better."
hap, How you doing?
neu, Fine.
hap," Is that -- is that, no? Was that just foam? I can't even tell."
hap," Although, I guess you can't tell it probably isn't them. Probably be unmistakable don't you think?"
hap, How you doing? You know what I forgot? I forgot to bring my flashlight. How - how could I forget to bring my flashlight? How could I be so stupid?
neu, What flashlight?
neu, Yea.
hap," You cold, you want my jacket? We should've - we should've brought our blanket, our blanket, how could we forget to bring the blanket?"
hap," Oh, a six-pack, that's, should've brought a -- a six-pack be just the ticket right now. How could I forget,"
hap," oh man. Like a kid, it's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped."
hap, You think they can hear us talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?
neu, I'm cold.
neu, Not particularly.
hap," Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean it only happens once a year."
hap," Think about the people in Kansas, they- they'd have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservations to see this. We live forty minutes away it's too good to pass up."
hap," Yea, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. I mean all that flopping is laying eggs or what do you, mating or spotting or something like that."
hap," This is a big night for these guys, life's last orgy."
hap," Okay. But it's fish that do something none of the other fish do. Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the Lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs"
hap," you know there is like, there is a certain mystery here, a magic, a bit of the unexplainable. I don't see how you cannot be interested."
sad, I'm just not.
neu, Yes.
ang," Last year you'll also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the Grunions."
hap," There is that, oh no that's just seaweed, isn't it?"
hap," This is, this is great, isn't it? I wouldn't miss this for anything. Now listen to this, I know you're not interested but just listen."
hap," Out there somewhere there is this huge mass of silver fish headed this way,"
hap," they don't why, we don't know why. They didn't take a vote or anything; they didn't get a map or an invitation."
hap," Just all as one. This little time sensitive firecracker, instinctual firecracker in their body just went off and all as one they turned and formed a line as long the California coast and started swimming. They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters."
hap," It's single mindedness, with no mind, it's urgency that's pure urge, they don't know what drives them. They don't ask it a name or ask it a question,"
hap," they just turn as one and start the swim and brings them right here to this spot where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death."
hap, Look at me; I'm giving myself goose bumps all my hairs are popping up.
neu, That's the wind.
neu, About what?
neu, So what do you think?
neu, What I was saying.
neu, Certainly it's not. Slightly exaggerated scientific fact.
ang, Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that. I hate it when you ask me that. You always ask me that. It's insulting.
ang, We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.
neu," Well, we'll see them this year."
ang, I mean I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on the beach waiting for the fish to show up with my eyes open and my hands clasped expectantly and the fish won't show up.
ang," I did want to see them, I always do. I mean I keep thinking that this is going to be the time and it never is."
neu," You were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was no problem, let's see, I took a shower, you watched the news, you said"
neu," ""the Grunion are running tonight,"" I said ""great, let's go, I feel lucky,"""
neu," okay so I'm getting on my jacket and putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage-"
sad, Do you remember the first time we came to see it? It was about four years ago right after we got married.
sad," We thought I was pregnant and we opened a bottle of champagne but no glasses, you asked me to dance, we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork."
sad, And when we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them
sad," and I remember thinking that this is it you know. At last, at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be"
sad," Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle."
hap," It was in the car, right? Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker you said, let's get some champagne and I said times are wasting or something like that, right?"
hap," Of course, I see it now; you want this to be like that other time, right? That's it, right?"
sad, I'd rather not remember some things. I would rather not hope for some things.
neu," Yea. Okay, sure, no. I see. Listen, you want to dance?"
sad, No.
neu, You want to go get some champagne?
sad, No.
neu, Take off our shoes?
neu, Get married again?
ang," Well welcome to the human race, all right. Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed? You think I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?"
sad," Well, but this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like."
sad," No, I know. Me neither."
sad," I know that you meant this to be special and nice, and there's the sand and the moon and everything but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else."
sad, Maybe if you were with somebody else too.
sad," No, I know. But still, I know I don't make you happy."
hap, Don't be ridiculous. I mean don't you know that?
sad," You're the one who probably wishes he was with someone else, someone who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard."
hap," Now that you mention it. No, I don't."
hap, I don't know it seemed like a pretty good spot to me. Look at the moon - view the moon view I got from here.
hap, What have we got here?
hap," Well, I guess we don't need glasses."
sad," Augie, I'm sorry."
hap," Shh, if we're very quiet the fish might come."
hap, Or not.
hap, Or not.
neu, Hmm.
hap, What are we going to do?
hap, Now and always sweet.
hap, Hello? Hello? What? Wrong number.
hap, Oh. It sends shivers down my spine.
hap, Behave exquisitely.
hap, With the most perfect poise.
hap," Yes, I should probably to a court curtsey."
hap," Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's is happy, do they?"
sad, Oh darling don't say that.
hap, Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love?
hap, What does it all mean that's what I ask- that's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth?  Good God what does it all mean?
hap," You mustn't be serious my dear one, that's just what they want."
hap, Who's they?
hap, flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness in light.
hap," Certainly you must, we figures of fun all right."
sad," No, that desire will fade along with our passion."
sad," Oh dear, should we like that?"
hap," Yes, yes, with all his might."
hap," No, no it isn't, death is very laughable, such a cunning little mystery, all done with mirrors."
hap, So is everyone else in the long run.
hap," Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers, let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can. Like quite idiotic, very small, school children. Let's savor the delight of the moment."
hap, Come kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.
hap, You remember that awful scene we had in Venice?
hap, Which particular one?
hap," Oh Charles, that was his name Charles. It did wiggle so beautifully."
hap, I know you did. You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal; I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.
hap, It went on intermittently for days.
hap, It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.
hap," That was a rouser, wasn't it?"
hap, The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.
hap, I'll never forget his face.
hap," Oh it was ridiculous, completely ridiculous."
hap, And very much sillier.
neu," As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden."
hap, You knew there was nothing in that.
ang, I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.
hap," Presents, just a trivial little broach."
neu, No it wasn't. It was very pretty I still have it and I wear it often.
ang, You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
neu," No I didn't, you worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination."
ang, You let him kiss you; you said you did.
neu, What of it?
neu," It gave him a lot of pleasure, it didn't hurt me any."
ang, What about me?
neu," Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious you never wouldn't have known anything about it."
neu, No thanks.
neu, I have a little I think.
neu," No particular reason. Anyhow, they are very small ones."
neu, It just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.
neu, You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.
neu," Well, it's become a habit with you."
ang, What?
neu, No I'm just making myself fascinating for you.
neu," Going out somewhere, dear?"
neu," As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true."
ang, Be quiet.
ang, I don't care. Do you understand? I don't care. I don't care if they bark or roll about like hoops.
neu," Tell me, did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?"
neu," Yes, I did quite a lot."
ang, What riotous time you must have had.
ang," No restraint at all, very enjoyable, never had much anyhow."
ang, Oh be quiet.
ang," We can get a good little debate going about that, don't you think? Intemperate tots."
neu, All right. I will.
neu, Better turn that off I think.
ang, You are far too temperamental. Try to control yourself.
ang, Turn it off.
ang, Stop it. Stop it. I hate you.
ang," Amanda, listen. Listen."
ang," Listen indeed. I'm sick and tired of listening to you, damn sadistic bully."
ang, Very amusing indeed.
ang," Stop it. Stop it. I hate you, do you hear? You're overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible."
ang," You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I hope I never see you again as long as I live."
ang," This is the end, do you hear? The end finally and forever."
ang, You're not going like this.
ang, Oh yes I am.
ang, You're not.
ang," Yes, I am. Let go of me you're cruel fiend and I hate and loathe you. Thank God I realized who you really are before I would ever, ever marry you again. I would never marry you again. I'd rather die in torment."
ang, Shut up.
ang, Shut up.
ang, I wouldn't marry you again if you came to me on your bended knees. You're a evil minded little vampire. I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live.
ang, You're a beast. I hate you. Stop it. Stop it.
