EMOTION,TRANSCRIPTION
neu, Excuse me.
neu, Yeah.
neu, Is there a problem?
neu, Well what's the problem?  Let me change it.
ang, That's out of control.
ang, I don't understand why this is so complicated for people when they get here.  It's just a simple form.  I just need an ID.
neu," Clearly.  You know, do you have like a supervisor or something?"
ang, Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Huh? Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Fine.  I'll be right back.
sad, Did you get the mail? So you saw my letter?
sad, Yeah.  I know.
sad," I don't understand.  You've already done so much, I don't know why do you have to go back."
sad, I don't know.  I put in that. request too. They didn't...
neu," I guess, you know, everybody has to make sacrifices."
sad," There's people that have given more though, you know?"
sad, I know.
neu," There's babies over there, though, that need mothers."
sad, I don't know how you can be okay with this?  I don't know why you're not-- you're fine with it.
sad," Just, you know, kicking myself."
sad, things just aren't what they seem.
sad, I just don't see why it has to be you.
sad," If not me then, who?"
sad, What am I going to do? Huh?
sad," You'll videotape everything, yeah?"
sad, Yeah.
sad," Maybe you can send it to me, like stream it, yeah?"
neu, Don't you guys have access to computers over there.
sad, Last month--  Yeah.
sad, I just don't know how I'm going to do it without you.
neu, I have to find sitters.
sad, I can't raise a baby by myself.  How?
sad," We've got friends, that's why we moved here, huh?  Because there is a day care down the street."
neu, I know.
neu, And your mother is close by.
sad, I'll send you lots of letters.
sad, And I want lots and lots and lots of pictures.
neu, So what's up?  What's new?
hap, Well Vegas was awesome.
neu, Yeah.  I heard.
hap," And, um, I got married."
hap, Yeah.  In the old town part.
hap, Who did you marry?
hap, Um- Yes.  It was very romantic.
hap, It was at the slot machines.
hap," Uhuh, uhuh.  He won big and he-and he realized that the only thing that would make it better was me as his bride."
neu, He turned to you and was like...
hap, [LAUGHTER] That's really romantic.
hap," Yeah.  Well.  You know, because he's leaving the next day."
neu, Yeah.
hap, But we're going to have a honeymoon cruise.
neu," Does that mean that you're going to get citizenship, too, in- in England or whatever?"
hap, Oh.  I hadn't even thought about that.
neu, Yeah.  But he'll have like a long visa.  Can you go visit then for a long time?
hap, Oh.  Totally.
hap, I guess I'll-  I guess I'll have an internet husband.[LAUGHTER]
hap, Like you need another one of those.[LAUGHTER]
hap, Is that your phone?
hap," Yeah, so [LAUGHTER] He's calling me now"
hap, He loves you.
hap," He likes to keep tabs, you know."
neu, How much did he win at the slot?
neu," Uh, I think seven hundred and fifty dollars."
neu, Penny slots. That's what he plays.
neu, Yeah.
neu, I'm a big fan of the Wheel of Fortune quarters. But it just costs so much.  I don't know.
hap, Yeah.  We played Wheel of Fortune pennies.  It's like a giant thing with like-
neu," But the pennies always get you because you end up spending like, you know, fifty bucks."
neu, Fifty bucks. Mmhmm.
neu," like, wait, but it's just pennies.  You're like, wait a minute I'm on to you."
neu, Yeah.
hap, Well so now we're married. We have cat children.
hap, Awesome.
hap, [LAUGHTER] Cat babies.
hap," We renamed Brenda, Lumber Janet."
neu, That's fair enough.
hap, She needs a new name each state that we go into. [LAUGHTER]
neu," Have you tried, uh, Craig's List?"
neu," Uh, what?  Craig's List?  Oh the internet thing?"
neu, Yeah.
neu, I don't know.  Isn't that-- that's all like escort services and things like that.
neu, No.  There's regular jobs on there.
neu, Uh huh.
neu, I'm just saying I have a friend that got a good job on it so I was just recommending it.
neu, He's like a manager for a theatre.
neu, He's like a house manager. Yeah.  It's a good job.
neu, He just...
neu, you know what?  I heard about that job.  I applied for that.
neu, You did?
neu, Yeah.
neu, You've been looking for a job for a long time; that was a long time ago.  Right?
neu, Yeah.
neu, Hmm.
neu, I don't know.  He had a really good resume I guess and--
neu, Yeah.  Do you have a resume?
neu, It's kind of helpful when getting a job.
neu, I just- I mean I call people up and I tell them what I'm good at.
neu, Well maybe we should sit down some time and you can just tell me all the stuff that you have done and I'll write it out.
neu, Yeah.
neu," No.  You can- or you can just bring it in person.  But they need, generally, something to see, you know, what kind of what that you've done, what kind of--"
neu," Yeah.  But the piece of paper helps, too."
neu," No.  But it has an outline, you know."
neu," I know.  Okay.  Well, um. Maybe--"
neu, Yeah.
neu," Okay, yeah.  I would imagine."
neu," Well, sometimes you have to do things that you don't necessarily like to do to have a job. But the job affords you money, you won't have to be taking the bus right now."
neu, maybe get a car.
neu," I just, you know, think you should try a little harder maybe."
neu, I didn't say that.
neu," I am riding the bus, but by choice."
neu," To save the environment, carpool."
neu, Yes.  One less car at a time.
neu, Mmhmm.
ang, I'm not frustrated.
ang, Who do you think you are?
neu, I don't think I'm anyone.
ang, You are so high and mighty.  I just--
neu, I- I-I didn't-- okay.
ang, Oh.  I'm saving the environment. I'm riding this car because I- I want to.
ang," The bus, I'm riding the bus because I want to."
ang, I can not-- you are not here by choice.  Nobody would ride this bus by choice.
neu, Hi.  Thanks for waiting.
hap, Can I help you?
hap, Uh huh.
neu, Okay.
neu, Okay.
neu, Okay.  Great.  I'm really sorry that you had to do that.  What's your last name?  Let's start there.
neu, Okay.
neu, all right- okay.  And you lost your bag? Is that- that the issue?
ang, Flight seven fourteen.
neu, Uh-huh.
ang," Am I going to be getting, like, free tickets, free mileage. When can I expect my bag here?"
neu," Yeah. Yeah, I don't see- I don't see any--"
neu," I don't see any record of it, and I-usually when I don't see a record of it, that means um-"
neu," we've mistakenly lost your baggage.  We're very sorry.  On behalf of Jet Blue I would like to apologize for any inconvenience.  I am allowed to issue you a fifty dollar gift card which you can use any future flights you want to take with us.  I'm very sorry, once again..."
neu," for such an inconvenience and your bag, but"
ang, Is this a joke?
neu, Yeah.
neu," No, no."
ang," Are there candid cameras?  Is this that movie? There's that show, right?  Airplane, airline."
neu," No, no.  This is real."
neu," No.  I'm just giving you money, the bag is gone.  If it's not here, I'm really sorry there is nothing I can do because..."
neu, this is the only track record that we have and if it's not listed here then it's probably not anywhere.
ang," You're kidding me, this is a joke."
ang, Do you have any idea-- fifty dollars?  That's supposed to replace everything that I have?  Do you understand how much I have packed in there? Not only does it have sentimental value; it can't be replaced like that.  It was incredibly expensive.
neu, Yes.
neu, I know.
ang, We flew in from Paris.  I've been shopping for three weeks.
ang, I don't care what you're freaking sign says.  Somebody- Somebody needs to replace everything I've got there and give me money for my inconvenience.
neu, Okay. Calm-
neu," Actually, we are not necessarily liable to give you- to even give you this fifty dollars so... it's actually- it's actually really"
ang, Do you understand who my husband is?
ang," If you're- if you're- if you're looking for a lawsuit, baby, you've found it."
neu," We are actually not even allowed--  you know, like we don't have to give you this fifty dollars.  We don't have to do that."
ang, Oh-Oh.  It's a gift.  You're-You're helping me out here?
neu, It's a gift.
neu," You know, the airlines can not be held responsible for every bag of luggage that comes through here."
ang, You are cruising for a bruising.  You are in so much trouble.
neu, With the amount of--
ang, Who's in charge?  Who is the president of Jet Blue?
neu," Um, actually, I don't know. I don't know. Oh really?"
ang, Because I probably know him.
ang, Yeah.
neu, Well then maybe you can just call him and he can give you more money.  But right now all I can do--
ang," I don't want money, I want my clothes."
neu," Right now all I can do is just give you this fifty dollars, I'm really sorry."
ang, What's your name?
neu, Oh.  My name is Sean. Hi.
ang, Okay.  I'll do that.
ang, I don't think you have done everything you could do because I don't have my bag here yet.
neu," If you want, you can write a letter.  I can give you the address. Yes.  An angry--"
ang, A letter? I'll make a personal phone call.
neu," Or you can make a phone call.  But I think a letter might be a little more-- in my impression, letters have more..."
sad," I'm sorry, Joy."
neu, Is there anything I can get you?  Do you want me to take care of anything for you or...?
neu, ...pick up anything?
sad, No.
sad, You know you are welcome to stay at my house if you want to just check out for a couple days and hang out.
neu, That's sweet.
neu, Thank you.
sad, I went to see her headstone a week or two ago.
sad," I used to go to cemeteries a lot before she died.  I just, you know, I felt like they were urban oasis, you know, there is always this green in the city."
neu, Hmm.
sad, So I was like wandering around before.  It takes forever to find her headstone; I always lose it. You know.
sad, So I was looking at this other one and there was like a piece of candy there and I thought that I would take the candy and put it on her headstone.  And-
neu," this woman came up and, you know, it was hers. It was her person that was there."
neu, Oh.  She was there?
sad," Yeah.  And she was like, that's pathetic, I hope you enjoy it."
sad," And I, you know, I mean, I said I was sorry and I brought it back to her kind of and I like put it on the ground and she was like, no, it's fine.  She was like, I would rather have her back, honestly."
neu, Mmhmm.
sad," I don't know.  It just, like, I felt so bad because I shouldn't have done it.  I don't know.  Whatever."
sad, Yeah.
sad, I don't know.
neu, How long were you there for?
sad, At the cemetery?
neu, Mmhmm.
sad, couple hours.
neu," I brought- I brought Chuck with me. He went to Redlands, yeah, for the day.  We ran through the sprinklers."
neu, Oh really?
neu, You ran through the sprinklers in the cemetery?
neu, Is it a big cemetery?
neu, Yeah.  It's huge.  Redlands is an old city so they have lots and lots of stones.
neu," Oh, so they're like really old too, really old ones?"
neu, Yeah.
sad," It's weird.  Whenever I go back to town, I think of her.  I mean, it's like ... I mean we grew up together and she died when we were twenty one.  And yeah.  She had cancer, she had two brain tumors."
sad," My best friend Heather.  She's got a- we have a- we built this like little--  There's a park, Prospect Park.  And there is like a garden section of it that we set up for her."
sad, She used to have these poetry parties on Memorial Day.
neu, Mmhmm.
sad, Umm. Yeah.
sad," And the last time before she died, I remember she couldn't really stand, umm..."
sad," But I mean she could, but it was- so it was kind of sitting at her feet holding her up and she had these poems she had memorized.  And I remember looking up, she had curly red hair and there was this palm tree right behind her and it was like a crown growing right out of her head.  It was cool."
neu, Mmhmm.
sad," Some, I guess.  She memorized this one, John Dunn, it's called, Death Be Not Proud. and-"
neu, So she wrote a lot of poetry?
neu," There's another one, I can't remember."
sad," I remember, too, when we were--  she died at U.C.L.A.  She had brain surgery and there was not much hope to begin with, but I gave blood for her surgery, her mom and I before, so we dropped her off in the waiting room and then we were giving blood and came back.  And she, in her wheelchair, like can hardly do anything, reciting her poetry for these people like in the waiting room.  All she needs is a God damn audience.  You know?"
hap, Did you get the letter?
hap," Yes.  There's a big envelope it says, you're in. I know."
hap, Yeah. That is so awesome.
hap, Oh my God. What are you going to do? [LAUGHTER]
hap," Oh-Yeah, I bet you're really excited. Oh.  That's what loans are for?  Right? Exactly."
hap," I'm really excited.  Yeah. I don't know how I'm going to pay for anything, but... I also- Yeah.  Loans, too, yeah. I applied, though, for a bunch of grants and scholarships so I'm still waiting to hear on that."
hap," Oh.  Good, good.  That's awesome. Are you going to stay around here?  Or are you going to like get a different neighborhood- you going to move to a different neighborhood?"
hap," Oh- I know, I know, I know, I know."
hap," I don't know.  I spend so much time commuting as it is, I'd rather."
hap, This is so- I am so happy that you're going to stay.  You're not going to...We should totally throw a party.
hap, I know. We should throw a party.
hap, A rapper party ho. Yeah. Okay.
hap," I am just- Yeah.  I'm sticking around, I'm just doing my thing.  I'm living here.  I'm so glad you're going to stay, I'm so glad you're going to be here. Yeah. Woo."
hap, Yeah.  Big time.
hap, Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Yay. So what major?  What are you doing?
hap, Yeah.  I'm not sure.
neu, Is this a Masters or a P.h.D.?  Or can you...? Nice
hap, Umm...P.h.D. [LAUGHTER]
neu," That's good.  Don't you have to like teach a class, too, when you do that?"
hap," Teacher. Mrs. Nash, I have a question."
hap, So I get to mold young minds. Mrs.?  That's my mother.
hap, You have to get married.  Well you are married to Chuck.  You're Mrs. Nash.  Not to be confused with Mrs. Dash which is the popular seasoning.
hap," I would be like- Oh. Right, right, right."
hap, Yay...School's fun.
neu," Of course, right.  That's where the real money is, being a student."
hap, That's how you get the big bucks.  Are you messing with the chair? Don't ruin it.
hap," I know. I made such a mess of it, the entire time.  The last three things I've done, I've ruined everything, I think. Mm-hmm.  Yeah."
neu, He saw it.
neu, He was out here when it broke.
neu, Four o clock this morning.  I heard a crack and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right over there when it cracked.
neu, I don't know.
neu," He's dreaming of him again, walking around."
neu, I guess he is.
neu, You know Larry is not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?
neu, We've got to say it to him.
neu," Sit down, Mom.  I want to talk to you."
neu, You know.
neu," Well I got an idea, but what's your story?"
neu, I'm going to ask her to marry me.
neu, You know it's not just my business.
neu," So all right then, I'll just go ahead with it?"
ang," You know sometimes you infuriate me.  you know that?  Isn't it your business if I tell father and he throws a fit about it?  God, you have such a talent for ignoring things."
neu, I wanted to get this settled first.
neu," Well if she does, then that's it.  That's the end of it.  From her letters, though, I think she's pretty much forgotten him."
neu, And then we'll thrash it out with father.  Okay Mom?  Don't avoid me.
neu, Just give it some more thought.
ang, What the hell is this?
neu," I'll get out.  I'll get married and I'll move somewhere else, maybe New York."
ang, You have a business here.  What the hell is this?
ang, Oh.  Must you be inspired?
neu," On this, I would."
neu, Then help me stay here.
ang," All right.  But you don't want to think like that because what the hell are we working for, Chris?  It's all for you.  This whole shooting match is for you."
ang, Just don't think like that.
neu, Well maybe...maybe he just wanted to see her.
ang, He's not going to marry her.
neu, How do you know he's even thinking about it?
ang, It's got that about it.
ang," What is going on here, Joe?"
ang, She is not his girl.  She knows she's not.
ang," Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men, why is she still single?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she waited."
neu, How do you know why she waited?
ang," Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my darkest moments, I think of her waiting and I know that I'm right."
ang," Nobody in this house dares take away her faith, Joe.  You know strangers might, but not his father, not his brother."
ang," I want you to-- I want you to act like he is coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since Chris invited her here."
ang, I won't stand for any nonsense.
ang," Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  Oh laugh, laugh all you like but why does this happen the very night he comes back.  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe, look."
ang," Just believe with me, Joe. Only last week a man came back in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  Believe with me. You, above all, have got to believe. Just believe."
ang," What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?"
neu, You're the only one who still loves his parents.
neu," I know.  It kind of went out of style, didn't it?"
neu, It's not so bad; it's a good thing.
neu," [BREATHING] You know, it's lovely here.  The air is sweet."
neu, You're not sorry you came.
neu," I'm not sorry, no. But I'm...I can't stay."
neu," For one thing, your mother much as told me to go."
neu, Well.
neu," And then, you.  You've been kind of..."
neu, What?
neu, Sort of embarrassed ever since I got here.
neu, Well I was kind of planning of sneaking up on you over the course of a week or so.  They just take it for granted that we're all set.
neu, I knew they would.
neu," Well sure, from your mother's point of view.  Why else would I come?"
neu," I, umm. I guess, I guess that's kind of why I came."
hap, [BREATHING]
hap," I love you. Annie, I love you."
hap, [LAUGHTER]
hap," I don't really have any imagination, that's all I know how to say."
hap, [LAUGHTER]
hap," Am I embarrassing you? Are you - See, I didn't want to do it here with this yard, on this porch.  I wanted it to be somewhere new, some place fresh for both of us."
hap, No. No
neu," Chris, I've been ready a long, long, time."
neu, I almost got married two years ago.
neu, You started to write me.
hap, Every day since.
hap, Why didn't you let me know?
hap, Give me a...
hap, Give me a kiss.
hap, beating around the bush.
hap," I will never forgive you.  All I'd done was sit around wondering if I was crazy waiting so long, wondering if you were thinking about me."
hap," Oh Annie, we are going to live now.  I am going to make you so happy."
hap, Not like that you're not.
hap, I kissed you.
neu," Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris."
sad," Hey, let's drive some place.  Huh?  Let's get out of here."
sad, No it's nothing like that. It's-
sad, Yeah.  I suppose I have been. But it's going from me.
sad, I don't even know how to start.
sad," It's just all mixed up with so many other things, you know?  You know overseas I was in command of a company?"
neu," Yeah, sure."
sad, Well I lost them.
neu, How many?
sad, Pretty much all.
sad," Aw, geez."
sad, You can't just toss off a thing like that because they weren't just men. You know?
sad," Like for instance, there was this one time it had been raining for several days and this kid he just came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.  He just put them in my pocket.  That's a little thing, you know, but that's what kind of guys I had."
sad," They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that, exactly.  Just a little more selfish and they would all be here today."
neu, Mmhmm.
sad," To bring that on to the earth again, you know, is like some kind of monument and I thought I would just make a difference to them."
sad," But then I came home and it was incredible, you know?  The whole thing was just kind of this random bus accident.  You know, I went back to the rat race again, I went to work."
sad, And I didn't want any of it. I guess that included you.
neu, I just want you to know Annie.
hap, What would I do with a fortune?
neu, Fine.
hap," Okay.  Is that, is that--"
neu," The flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?"
neu, That's not your flashlight.
neu, Whose is it?
neu," Oh...well. Yeah, of course."
ang, You keep saying my flashlight like it's just yours.
neu, No.
ang, How's that supposed to make me feel?
neu," Of course, our flashlight.  What's yours is mine.  Me flashlight es su flashlight."
neu, Do they always run during a full moon?  I don't remember.  Was it full last year?
neu, Yeah.
neu," Huh.  Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  No?  you know, we should have brought the blanket?  Our blanket."
neu," Aw.  Do you know, I should have brought a six pack, too.  A six pack, that would be just the ticket right about now.  Huh?"
hap," God, I'm so excited, I'm like a kid.  I can't believe I got out of the house with my fly zipped up."
hap, [LAUGHTER]
sad, I'm cold.
neu, Right.
neu," Wait, that's my point, too."
neu, Not particularly.
neu, Why not?
neu," Honey, this is like a natural phenomenon. I mean... People in Kansas would have to get plane reservations and get hotel rooms to see this.  It's just forty minutes away for us; it's too good to pass up."
neu, Yeah.  But this..this moment on the beach is like the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what to do - spawning or mating or whatever.
neu, This is a big night for these little guys.  It's like life's last orgy.
neu," There's like mystery here, there's magic.  It's like a little bit of the unexplainable.  I just can't see how you're not interested."
neu," God, I don't get it.  you know the first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life?"
neu," And last year, I remember distinctly you said, you were so excited to get here that you don't remember you stubbed your toe until we were in the car."
neu, Ahh...we weren't in a good spot.
neu," We just weren't in a good spot.  I'm telling you, this is a much better spot.  I have instincts for these things."
hap," Look there, see?  What's that?  No, that's - that's just seaweed."
hap," God, this is great.  Think about this.  I know you are not interested, but just think about this."
hap," Just all at once, they turned and they formed this line as long as the California coast.  And some instinctual little firecracker went off in their bodies and they all just turned as one and started swimming."
hap, It's single mindedness with no mind.  It is urgency that is just pure urge.
neu, That's the wind.
hap, So what do you think?
neu, About what?
hap," About all of that, about all I was talking about."
hap," Look at this, all of the hairs are standing up on my arm."
neu, That's the wind.
hap," Well, so, what do you think?"
neu, About what?
neu, About what I was saying.
neu," Carla, can I ask you something?  Now, don't take this the wrong way, but are you on your period?"
ang," Don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that, you always ask me that.  It's insulting."
ang," For God- Grow up, Augie.  The fish are not going to arrive."
ang, Because they never do.  Have they...Have they ever?
ang, Twice is every time we have tried; that's ever.
sad," I feel like I'm always just standing here waiting.  I feel like this night is going to be the night, but it never is."
ang," For God's sake, this is not about fish."
neu," Okay.  So you were fine during that phone call from Marge and then dinner was okay.  And doing the dishes was fine and then I was going to take a shower and you're watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight, do you want to go?  And I said, sure great, let's go."
neu," Okay.  So I am putting out the pets, getting the car out of the garage."
neu, Do you remember the first year we came here?  It was like four years after we got married.
hap," You whispered the sweetest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.  And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, finally, I am as happy as I'm supposed to be."
neu," It's when we were driving past that Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, let's get some champagne.  I said no, time's a wasting or something like that."
sad, I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.
neu, Sure.  All right.  Okay.
neu," Listen, do you want to dance?"
neu, No.
neu, Do you want me to go get some champagne?
hap, Do you want to take off your shoes?
hap, Do you want to get married again?
neu, No.
neu, Yes it is.
sad," I know you are Augie, I know."
sad," I know you meant this to be special, I know that you wanted it to be right, but I just can't help thinking that, I can't help wishing that I was somewhere else."
sad," Maybe if you were with someone else, too."
sad, I didn't say that.
sad, I just- I know I don't make you happy.
sad," You're the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else.  Somebody who doesn't take things so seriously, who could enjoy herself."
neu," You know, actually now that you mention it, no I don't."
neu," So maybe we are in the wrong spot, but we are with the right person."
neu," We have a great view of the moon from here, though, huh?"
hap," Hmm.  I noticed that, it's pretty. Big old white moon."
neu, [BREATHING]
hap, And look what I got here.
hap," Augie, you bought refreshments."
hap, I guess we don't need glasses.
hap, [BREATHING]
neu, Do you want to go home?  Are you cold?
hap, I'm beginning to think this might be the right spot after all.
sad," Augie, I'm sorry."
neu," Shh.  If we're very quiet, the fish might come."
neu, Or not.
hap, Or not.
hap, I don't care then.
hap, No.  Wrong number. [LAUGHTER]
hap, [LAUGHTER] That sent shivers up my spine.
hap, What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us.[LAUGHTER]
hap, We'll behave exquisitely.
hap, With perfect poise.
hap, I think I shall do a curtsy.
hap," It's strange; things that ought to matter dreadfully, they just don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they?"
hap, Yes.  Meaning just that.
hap," Well what does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?"
hap, Don't laugh at me.  I'm being serious.
hap, Who's they?
hap, Who knows?
hap, Yes.  Yes with all of his might.
hap," Let's be superficial, and just pity those poor philosophers, huh?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party for as long as we can, you know, like small, idiotic school children."
hap, [LAUGHTER]
hap, Oh Come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets.
hap," Oh Elliott, worms don't pop."
hap," Oh See, I don't care what you do, see.  You can paint yourself green and run naked through the Place Vendome and run off with all of the men of the world.  I shan't say a word, just as long as you love me best."
hap," Aw.  Thank you, darling.  The same applies to you too, except that if you so much as look at another woman I'll kill you."
hap," Oh Charles, that was his name.  He did wiggle so beautifully."
hap," That was a rouser, wasn't it?"
hap," The manager came in, he found us rolling about the floor, biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER]  How utterly, utterly ridiculous."
hap, [LAUGHTER] I'll never forget his face. [LAUGHTER]
hap, [LAUGHTER] We were very much younger then.
hap, [LAUGHTER] And very much sillier.
hap, And very much sillier.
neu, However I believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.
hap, Oh.  You knew there was nothing in that.
neu, I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.
hap," Presents?  It was only a trivial, little brooch."
neu, You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
neu, I did not.  You worked that whole thing up in your jealous imagination.
neu," Well, what of it?"
ang, What about me?
neu," I'll have a little, I think."
neu," No particular reason.  Anyhow, they are very small ones."
ang, Don't be stupid.
ang," Really, Amanda."
ang, What?
neu," you going out somewhere, dear?"
ang, No.  I am just making myself fascinating for you.
ang, Oh.  It's a woman's duty to allure the man.
neu," Well as a matter of fact, yes, that's perfectly true."
ang, No it isn't.
neu, Yes it is.
ang, You shut up.
ang," Oh really.  It's a pity you didn't have any brandy, it would have made you a little less disagreeable."
ang," Snap, snap, snap.  You know you are like a little adder."
ang, Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap. They snap.
ang, They sting. I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care if they bark and they roll about like hoops.
ang, Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?
ang," Yes I did, quite a lot."
ang," And I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more than, too. Yes.  I suppose you guys had a riotous time, huh?  All out, no restraint at all.  Well, you never really had much anyhow."
ang, Mind your own business.
ang," You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you are drunk."
ang, I think I am not in the least bit drunk.
ang, You've always had a weak head.
ang, I think I mentioned once before that I've had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A child of two cannot get drunk on that.
ang," On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy."
ang," That's very interesting Amanda. How about a child of four?  Or a child of six?  Or a child of nine? We can get a good little conversation going on about this, you know, intemperate tots."
ang, Oh shut up.
ang, Shut up.
ang," Not very funny, darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy."
ang," Look, you better turn that off. I don't want to wake up the people upstairs."
neu, Why?
neu, There are no people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.
ang, Well then you'll wake up the people downstairs.
neu, They are away in Tunis.
neu, This is no time of year for Tunis.
ang, I will do no such thing.
ang, Fine if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.
ang," Will you turn that off, it's driving me mad."
ang," You are far too temperamental, try to control yourself."
ang, Turn it off.
ang," I won't.  Let go, let go of me. Listen, listen?  I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully."
ang," Amanda, listen, listen."
ang, Oh.  That's very amusing indeed.
ang," Oh shut up.  Let go.  I hate you, I hate you.  Do you hear?  You are a conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible."
ang," You are a vile, ill-tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I never want to see you again as long as I live."
ang, This is the end.  Do you hear me?  Finally and forever.
ang, You're not going like this.
ang, Oh.  Yes I am.
ang, You're not.
ang," Yes I am.   Stop it. Stop it.  Let go of me. Oh.  You're a cruel fiend.  I loathe and I hate you. Marry you again?  Never, never, never. I hope you die in torment, you brute beast cad."
ang," Shut up. Shut up. God, I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling back to me on a bended knee.  You are a vile, ill-tempered, mean little wench and I never want to see you again as long as I live."
ang, Next.
ang, My window is open.
neu," Yes, Jones."
ang," No, I need your ID to give you a second ID."
ang, It's really simple if you have a problem with it... Maybe you should--
neu," No, I don't have a passport."
ang, What do you expect me to do?
ang, Probably.
ang, Did you even look at the form?  I filled it out all these questions--
ang, Don't raise your voice with me.
ang, Don't talk to me like I'm a child.
ang, Do you know how long I've been working here? How long have you lived in California?
ang," Maybe you never been to the D.M.V. before, maybe you should get back in line.  You know what?  sit in line again and if you get my number ask for different one."
ang, I am not...I'm not getting to back that line.
neu, Uh huh.  I didn't come here get in yelling match either.
neu, They don't pay me enough to deal people like you.
ang, Why?
ang," Why, because I'm sick of talking to you."
ang," 'Cause you're obviously not talking to me, you're just yelling at me, berating me and telling me I can't fill out forms right."
neu," Hey, Joy come in here."
neu, What's happening?
sad, I have to go back.
sad, I just got a letter I have to go back.
sad, First thing tomorrow morning.
sad," The National Guard is I guess really spread thin and then everyone has to go.  We all have to go back, my whole companies going back."
sad," So yeah, we leave tomorrow..."
sad, ...we're all shipping out.
sad, I just got I feel like I'm in shock actually.
sad, I don't even know what to tell you.
sad, I don't know.
sad, What about the birthday party?
sad, I guess you're just going to have to have it without me.
sad," Hey listen, it's going to be okay though, all right?"
sad, You're going to be fine.
sad," I'm going to be fine too, okay?"
sad, I know I have a good... I have a really good group of guys with me.
sad, We're going to be okay.
sad, You're going with the same ones?
sad, Do promise me you're going to take a lot of pictures.
sad, I know.
sad, It's not the same though.
sad, I just wish there was something I could do.
sad, Run away?
sad, Mm hmm.  We'll build a bunker and never come out.
sad," I really don't want to go, I don't want to go..."
sad, Don't say that.
sad, I love you.
hap, The craziest thing just happened to me.
hap, This girl; she just offered me fifty thousand dollars to marry her.
hap, Why?
neu," Well, she's not a citizen so she wants to get a visa."
hap, Is she on the run?
hap," No, no, no, no, no, no she just... she's not a citizen but she wants her visa, yeah. She's going to pay me fifty thousand dollars to marry her and stay married to her for two years."
hap," Oh, she just needs to marry you."
hap, That's incredible. That's awesome. Where's she from?  Maybe you can get a dual citizenship.
hap, That's like twenty five thousand dollar a year for doing nothing. Isn't that awesome?
neu," She's actually from England, I think.  Well she- she spoke English but she had an accent. I didn't even ask."
hap, That's so cool. Uh huh.

hap, I know. What do you think I should-
hap," Like make her rent the apartment that you two have to live together in, you know. And you won't pay any rent or you pay like, a hundred bucks a month or something."
hap, Oh good idea.
neu, Yeah.  Make her like open the bank account and stuff too.
hap, Yeah.
hap, It's a good idea.
hap," Dude, you lucked out."
hap, I know.  Also I get to like plan the wedding now too. That will be fun.
hap," Yeah.  My colors are blush and beige what is it, do you know?"
hap," Something blue, something new, something... no I don't know. [LAUGHTER] So yeah, wonder if she's going to pay me up front but do you think it's bad though, do you think they're going to like track the money or something?"

neu, ...and you're always right.
neu, You have an excuse for everything.
neu, I'm just saying that maybe you should take in some information before you produce more of your own.
ang, I'm like a sponge I'm like soaked up with all this information for like three years I'm just dying for a job to like put it in to.
neu, [BREATHING]

neu, I've been college educated.
neu, I speak your language.
ang, Are you insinuating that I don't have a college education and that- for some reason that makes you a better person than I am?
ang," Listen, shut your smug mouth, okay?  I don't need that."
neu, I'm just saying you don't need to talk to me like I-
ang, I've been sitting here for four hours.
ang, You people have just been tossing me around like a used hanky.
ang, You work here.
neu," Details, Details.  Well, anyhow can I--"
neu, so you flew in from Atlanta...
neu, Four...Four hours ago.
neu, Do you have any i-?
neu, I wouldn't let you?   I was not in Atlanta. I was not in Atlanta.
neu, I had nothing to do with the boarding attendance.  I'm sorry that your seat was wherever it was.
neu," I have some unfortunate news, uh, that your bag isn't going to be--"
neu, --arriving any time soon.
neu, I'm really sorry to tell you this but...

neu, I wish I-
neu, That's not - no.
neu, No.
ang, It'll be a lot more than what you're doing sitting here and just give me lip service.  I'd like to go back at least do some aggressive searching for my stuff.
neu, We have plenty of aggressive searching going on it's not there.  Someone's taken it.
ang," Sure, yeah right you have plenty of aggressive searching going on, aggressive searching, drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes."
ang, I know what you guys do when you're not working you're union people; you just sit around on your ass.

sad, So weird you know that like one days it's like you know sounds so stupid but like one day someone's here. And like next day you know they're not here and it just kind of makes you like think about like life and mortality and like that kind of stuff.  You just like used to take for granted--you know.
neu, Mmhmm.

neu, Mmhmm.
neu, The plans you make [GARBAGE].
sad," Exactly, you know, and like he had so many plans and he was going to do..."

hap, Professional softball player Malibu. [LAUGHTER]
hap, I don't know. Commuting from what Malibu that would be ridiculous.

hap, Oh yeah. He'd drop you right off at practice?
hap, They have those neon--softballs.  They're like day-glow you can see them anywhere.

hap, They do it's--believe me it's huge.
hap, Who do you play? Like do--are you like... nationally ranked?
hap, I just got into it. I just kind of fell into it. Literally I was walking around and...
hap, That is unbelievable.
hap, It's pretty wild.
hap, I would put that right up there with--ping-pong.
neu," Yeah, well I doubt [GARBAGE] ping pong [GARBAGE]"
hap, I mean not to denigrate what you are doing.  I think that's great.
hap," No, no.  I love softball. I played softball all the time."
hap, I am not saying you should be. I'm not no. I think it's great I think you should be incredibly proud yourself especially because you're going to U.S.C for free for doing it. For free.
hap, For free that's really what it's about. I mean who cares I mean if I have to play softball all the time?
neu, Yeah we have like away games and stuff.
neu, But you know I'm like [GARBAGE].
hap, You're like the rookie? The new kid.
hap, Just watch in five years you'll be like on the force. You carry around donuts in your back pocket... [LAUGHTER]
hap, I'm going to have a mustache...On the force...
hap, Pull over..
neu, He saw it.
neu, I was out here at four this morning I heard a crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right over there.
sad, I don't know.  But he went back in the kitchen and he cried.
sad, Did you talk to him?
sad, No.  I figured I'd just let it wait.
sad, Cried hard?
sad," Yeah, I could hear him crying through the floorboards in my room."
sad, [BREATHING]
sad, I don't know.
ang," He's dreaming about him again, walking the streets."
sad, I guess he is.
ang, What do you mean a mistake?
ang," What, can you prove it?  What proof do you have?  Can you prove it?"
ang," To you it is, to me it is.  But to your father?  You can talk yourself 'til you're blue in the face but there's was no grave and there is no body.  So where are you?"
ang, The trouble is those god damn news papers.  Every month some boy comes back missing longer then Larry so--
ang, Why?
neu, I'm going to ask her to marry me.
ang," Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough known your own business."
ang," See.  Then it's not just my business. Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  You know it's just your business too if I tell father and he throws a fit about it, huh?"
ang, I'm sorry.  I ignore what I've got to ignore. That girl is Larry's girl.
ang, She is not Larry's girl.
ang," From father's point of view he is not dead and you have no right to take his girl.  I'm just saying that you can go on from there if you know where to go but I'm saying I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know."
neu, You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that.
ang, To hell with that.
neu, Did you ask Annie yet?
sad," No, I wanted to get this all sorted out first."
ang, I don't see why it has to be Annie.
ang," That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years."
sad," He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl you're pronouncing him dead."
ang," Do you know what that'll do to you, to your father, do you know?  I don't."
ang, Are you crazy?
ang, You have a business here.  I said what the hell is this?
ang, Business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
ang," Oh, must you be inspired."
ang," Yes, yes I like it for one hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long when I come home I want it nice, I want a family, I want to kids and Annie is in the center of that."
neu," Yes, on this I would."
ang," Well, you don't want to think like that."
sad, Then help me stay here mom.
ang," All right but you don't think like that because what the hell is this all for.  This is all for you, what are we working for Chris? The whole shooting match is for you."
sad, Then help me stay.
ang," Well, you don't think like that."
ang, I am thinking like that.
ang," I don't understand you, do I?"
sad," No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy."
ang," Well, I can see that."
ang, Why did he invite her here?
neu," Well, maybe he wanted see her."
ang, It's been three and a half years.  Why all of a sudden?
neu," Well uh, He grew up next door to the girl, why wouldn't he want to see her?"
ang," What is going on here, Joe?"
ang, The girl is not Larry's.  If the girl is Larry's girl she's not his she know she's not.
neu, And how do you know why she's waited.
ang," I want you to---act like he is coming back.  Don't think I haven't noticed you, both of you since Chris invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense."
ang," Oh, laugh at me, laugh all you like but why does this happen to very night she comes back?  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe look."
ang," Believe with me Joe, you got to believe. Only last week a boy came back missing longer then Larry you read it yourself."
ang, You above all have got to believe. Just don't stop believing.
ang, What does that mean? Me above all? What does that mean?
ang, Look at you. You're shaking.
ang," What the hell do you want from me, Kate?"
neu, The only one I know still love his parents.
hap," Yeah, that kind of went out of style didn't it?"
neu, Oh it's not bad thing it's good thing.
hap, You're not sorry you came?
sad," Not sorry, no.  I can't stay here."
sad, Why not?
neu, For one thing your mother as much as told me to go.
sad, [BREATHING] And then you've been kind of...
neu, What?
sad, You've been kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.
neu, You did?
neu, From her point of view why else would I come?
neu, Yeah--
hap," Ann, I love you.  I love you."
neu, I almost got married two years ago.
neu, Why didn't you?
hap, Everyday since.
hap, why didn't you let me know?
hap," Because I was waiting for you, Chris.  Till then you never wrote me and then when you did, well, you sure can be ambiguous you know."
hap, I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.
hap, I'll never forgive you for waiting so long.  All I did was sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking about you.
hap, I kissed you.
sad," Chris, what's the matter?"
sad, Do you want to go somewhere?  Let's go.
sad," No, what is it?  Is your mother?"
sad," No, no, it's nothing like that."
sad, I don't know it's--it's complicated. But it's going from me now.
sad, You got to tell me.
sad, I don't know.
sad, It's kind of all mixed up with all these other things.
sad, Wouldn't work like this.
sad, you know over seas I was in command of the company?
sad," Yeah, sure."
sad, Well I lost them.
sad, How many?
sad, Pretty much all.
sad, [BREATHING]. Geez.
sad," Takes awhile to toss something like that off.  I mean they weren't just men, you know."
sad," For instance, there was this one time when this kid--it had been raining for like several days and he gave me his last pair of dry socks."
sad, He just put it in my pocket that's the kind of guys I had.
sad," They didn't die they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly, you know a little more selfish and they'll all be here today..."
sad," And I had this idea as I was watching them go down like everything was being destroyed, you know.  But I felt like this one new thing was being made, you know it's kind of like this.  This monument..."
sad," You know, that they were bringing something on to this earth, a kind of sacrifice you know."
sad," I thought I would change everything you know, and I got back here and it was- it was like nothing had changed at all..."
sad, You know.  I went to work with dad and I started that whole rat race again...
sad, And no one had changed it was just like sort of random bus accident to them.
sad, Driving my new car and I felt guilty you know opening my bank book seeing a new refrigerator.
sad, 'Cause you can take those things out of a war.  But you have to realize that those things came out of the love that a man can have for another man...
sad, And if you can't see that then it's just loot and there's blood all over it.
sad, I felt ashamed and I didn't want any part of it.  I guess I included you too.
sad, Do you still feel that way?
sad, I want you to know Annie.
hap, I'm going to make a fortune for you.
hap, What would I do with a fortune?
hap," What time is it?  God, this is great, isn't it?  I can't believe it."
hap," Of course I did want to a little further up the coast you know get away from all the lights and people and everything.  Is it midnight, do they always start at midnight?  Is that what it is midnight?  How you doing, huh? You okay?  That's good."
hap," Look, there what's that, what's that?  Is it--"
hap," Oh, no I can't tell though.  Although probably if you can't tell it probably isn't them right, yeah.  Probably going to be like unmistakable, right?"
hap," Gosh, this is great, isn't it?  This is awesome.  Oh, no you know what I forgot?"
neu, Flashlight the silver one.  There's only one isn't there?
neu," Oh, well, yeah of course."
ang," You keep saying ""my flashlight"" like somehow it's just yours. How's that supposed to make me feel?"
neu," Of course, our flashlight.  What's your is mine, mi flashlight es su flashlight."
neu," Gosh, I should have brought it. I can't believe I forgot that."
neu, No.
hap," You know what we should've brought a blanket too.  Man, our blanket, our blanket.  Wish I had six-pack too, a six-pack would be just the ticket right about now, huh, six-pack."
neu, I'm fine.
hap," Oh yeah, I'm so excited right now I'm like a kid."
hap, I can't believe I got out of the house without my fly zipped up even.
hap, I wonder if they can hear me talk
neu, Right.
neu, That's my point too.
ang, Then let's go.
ang, People in Kansas would have to get plane tickets and make hotel reservations to see this.  It's only forty minutes away; it's just too good to pass up.
ang," Pass what up?  These little fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the sand then they swim back and then they die."
neu," Yeah, they do."
hap," Well, okay whatever, okay but it's a fish who do something that like no other fish do, you know, it's like those swallows that return to Capistrano or those like those lemmings that jumped off the cliffs, you know."
hap," It's like a little bit of the unexplainable, a little magic, a little mystery.  I just don't see how you can not be interested in this."
ang, Yes.
ang," Last year, you'll also remember we got--our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions."
neu, We just weren't in a good spot though.
ang, We didn't see them the year before either.
neu," Come on, trust me I got instincts for these things, okay?  So just--just think about it all right?  Okay, I know you're not interested, think about it..."
hap," Out there, there's like this big mass of silver fish they're heading this way..."
hap," They don't know why, we don't know why.  No one like sent them an invitation or gave them a map or direction..."
hap, They just all turned at once and they just form this line as long as the California coast.  And they just started swimming...
hap, Like some little time release fire cracker went off inside their little tiny bodies.  And they all turned as one...
hap," And form the line and started swimming, swimming that would bring them to this point here..."
hap, It's like urgency that's pure urge you know.  It's single-mindedness with no mind.
hap," It's crazy.  Look at this, I'm giving myself goose bumps, the hairs are standing up on my arm."
hap, ...to this spot for this massive celebration of like sex and death...
hap," Look at this, my hairs are standing up my arm. I'm giving myself goose bumps."
neu, That's the wind.
hap," Well, so?  What do you think?"
neu, Can I ask you a question?  Are you on your period?
ang," Why do you ask me that?  God damn it, I told you not to ask me that I hate it when you ask me that. It's insulting."
ang," I just, we just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like."
ang," Because they never do.  Do they, have they ever?"
neu, We missed them twice.
ang, Twice is every year we've tried that's ever.
ang, No we won't.  It's pointless it's like a waiting up to see Santa Claus.
ang," I feel like my whole life is going to be spent here on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly, waiting for fish to show up and the fish never show."
neu," you were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was fine."
neu," Let's see, uh, I took a shower and, um, you were watching the news and you said the ""the Grunions are running tonight,"" and I said ""okay great, let's go."""
neu, So I'm putting the animals out we're getting the car to the garage and--
neu, Do you remember the first year we came here? It's about four years ago right after we got married.
sad," And I remember thinking this is it. finally, finally I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be."
neu," Wait a minute, I've got it."
neu," It was when we were driving passed that knickerbocker liquor locker and you would said, no you said ""let's get some champagne"" and I said ""no time to wasting"" or something like that.  That's what it is, right?"
sad, I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.
neu," Oh right sure, of course."
sad, No.
neu, You want me to go get some champagne?
sad, No.
neu, Do you want to take off our shoes?
neu, What? Huh?
neu, You want to get married again?
ang," A new carpet, a poodle, a suicide pact, ice cream, a back rub, what?  What?  What the hell do you want?"
ang, I want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to.
ang, You think nothing turns out how it's supposed to.  You think I had some grand idea going that four years down the line.  We would come to this beach and argue over fish?  No.
sad," No, no I'm just like you, I thought it was going to be all rosy cheeks and the bills would pay themselves and fish will always come and--"
sad, No.  You know what you get?  You know what you get?  You get this.
ang, This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.
neu," Yeah, it is."
ang," Oh, sure this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, fighting."
neu, Right.
sad, This isn't anything like I thought anything would be.
sad, I know me neither.
sad, This is just this.  I mean it includes a lot and everything but it's--do you understand what I'm saying?
sad, I'm doing the best I can.
sad," I know that Augie, I really do."
sad," I just can't help wishing that I was somebody, somewhere else."
sad, Maybe if you were with somebody else too?
sad, I didn't say that.
sad," No, I know but--I know I don't make you happy."
sad, Yeah?
sad," You are the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else, someone who didn't take everything so seriously, someone who would enjoy yourself."
hap, Look what we got here.
neu, It's not champagne.
hap, I guess we don't need glasses.
neu," Are you cold, huh?  Do you want to go home?"
hap, I'm beginning to think you might be right.  I think this might be the spot after all.
sad," Augie, I'm sorry."
hap, Shh...
hap," If we are really quiet, the fish might come."
neu, Or not.
neu, Or not.
hap, Now and always sweet.
hap, I don't care then.
hap, It had to happen sooner or later.
hap, [BREATHING]
hap, Oh. Behave exquisitely...
hap, With perfect poise...
hap, [LAUGHTER] I think I shall do a court curtsey.
hap, Ah...
hap, [LAUGHTER]
hap, Ah...Strange...
hap, Mmm...
hap," Things that just ought to matter dreadfully, you know they just don't matter at all when one is happy, do they?"
sad," Darling, don't say that."
hap," Oh, yes meaning just that."
hap," Oh, dear god what is that all mean, dear god?"
hap, [LAUGHTER] Don't laugh at me I'm being serious.
hap," You mustn't be so serious, darling, it just what they want."
hap, Flippancy brings out the acid in their darn sweetness and light.
hap," Mmhmm If I must laugh at everything, I must laugh at us too."
hap," How long will it last, this ludicrous, overbearing love of ours?"
hap, We are figures of fun all right
hap, Ahh...who knows.
hap, Shall we always want to bicker and fight?
hap, If one of us dies...
hap, I think you're talking nonsense.
hap," Let's pity the poor philosophers, huh?  Let's enjoy the party for as long as we can, okay?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and sit like small idiotic school children. [LAUGHTER]"
hap," Come here darling, kiss me"
hap, before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets.
hap," See, you know I don't care what you do.  You could paint yourself green and run naked to the Place Vendome."
hap, Do you remember that row we did have in Venice?
hap, Which particular one?
hap," Oh, Charles.  That was his name Charles. He did wriggle so beautifully."
hap, But you know it wasn't as bad as the one we had in Cannes...mmhmm...where your curling irons burnt a hole in my dressing gown.
hap, Cannes...mmhmm...
hap, The manager came in he found us rolling about the floor.  [LAUGHTER]
hap, I will never forget the look on his face.
hap, Scratching and biting like panthers. [LAUGHTER] Oh...
hap, oh...
hap," Utterly, utterly ridiculous."
hap, oh...[LAUGHTER]
hap, We were very much younger then.
hap, Very much sillier.
hap, Oh you knew there was nothing in that.
neu," Well, what of it?"
neu," No, thank you."
neu," I'll have a little, I think."
ang, I don't see why you want any you already had two glasses.
neu," Oh, you know no particular reason besides they are very small glasses."
ang," Don't be stupid, what?"
neu, Are you going out somewhere dear?
ang, Well it's a woman's duty to allure the man. Watch me a minute will you?
ang," You know, it's a pity you didn't have any more brandy. It would have made you just a little less disagreeable."
ang," You know what?  You snap, you snap, you snap you're like a little adder."
ang, Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind of fangs and they snap.
ang, They sting.
ang," I don't care.  I don't care, do you understand?  I don't mind if they bark and they roll about like hoops."
ang, Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?
ang," Yes, I did quite a lot."
ang, I suppose you let him just kiss you or good deal more than too.
ang," Oh, mind you own business."
ang," I suppose you two had a riotous time, huh?  No restrain at all, very enjoyable, he never had much any how."
ang," You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you're drunk."
ang, I am not in the least bit drunk.
ang, You always had a weak head.
ang, I think I told you once before that I had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A Child of two cannot get drunk on that.
ang," On the contrary, a child two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy."
ang," Oh very, very interesting Amanda.  How about the child of uh... four, six or maybe nine---you know, we could work up a splendid little debate about it, you know?  Intemperate tots."
ang, Shut up.
ang, Not very funny darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy?
ang, That's a very good idea I think I will.
ang, Would you uh...turn that off please? You're going to wake the people upstairs.
ang, Why?
ang, Well then you'll wake the people downstairs.
ang, They are away in Tunis.
ang, This is no time a year for Tunis.
ang," Turn it on again, please."
ang, I will do no such thing.
ang, Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.
ang, Turn it off. It's driving me mad.
ang, I won't.
ang, Turn it off.
ang, Stop it. No. Go away.
ang, Amanda listen. Listen.
ang," listen Oh I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you damn sadistic bully."
ang, That's very amusing indeed.
ang," Oh you're cruel you're...you're...I hate you, I hate you. Go away. You're conceited. You're overbearing. You're utterly impossible."
ang," You...You're an evil minded, self-centered little wench and I never want to see you again."
ang, This is the end do you hear me?  Finally and forever.
ang, You're not going like this.
ang," Oh yes I am...Oh yes I am. Let go of me. You let go. You...urgh...You're a cruel friend. I loathe and I hate you. Marry you again...Ha...Never, never, never, never. I hope you die in torment. You beast."
ang, No you're not.
ang, Shut up. Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling back to me on a bended knee. You are an evil tempered little vampire and I never want to see you again as long as I live.
