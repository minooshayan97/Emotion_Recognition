TRANSCRIPTION,EMOTION
 Excuse me.,neu
 Yeah.,neu
 Is there a problem?,neu
 You did.,xxx
 You were standing at the beginning and you directed me.,xxx
 Well what's the problem?  Let me change it.,neu
 What?  I'm getting an ID.  This is why I'm here.  My wallet was stolen.,fru
 How am I supposed to get an ID without an ID?  How does a person get an ID in the first place?,fru
 I'm here to get an ID.,fru
 Like what?  Like a birth certificate?,fru
 Who the hell has a birth certificate?,xxx
" Yes but my wallet was stolen, I don't have anything.  I don't have any credit cards, I don't have my ID.  Don't you have things on file here?",fru
 That's out of control.,ang
 How long have you been working here?,fru
" Clearly.  You know, do you have like a supervisor or something?",neu
 That would - I would appreciate that.  Yeah.,fru
 Do you have your forms?,fru
 Let me see them.,fru
 Who told you to get in this line?,fru
 Okay. But I didn't tell you to get in this line if you are filling out this particular form.,fru
 This form is a Z.X.four.,fru
" You can't--  This is not the line for Z.X.four.  If you're going to fill out the Z.X.four, you need to have a different form of ID.",fru
 No. I need another set of ID to prove this is actually you.,fru
 I don't know.  But I need an ID to pass this form along.  I can't just send it along without an ID.,fru
" No.  I need another ID, a separate one.",fru
" A birth certificate, a passport...a student ID; didn't you go to school?  Anything?",fru
" Yeah.  We keep it on file, but we need an ID to access that file.",fru
 I don't understand why this is so complicated for people when they get here.  It's just a simple form.  I just need an ID.,ang
 Actually too long.,xxx
 Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Huh? Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Fine.  I'll be right back.,ang
 Did you get the mail? So you saw my letter?,sad
 Yeah.  I know.,sad
 I don't know.  I put in that. request too. They didn't...,sad
" I guess, you know, everybody has to make sacrifices.",neu
" There's people that have given more though, you know?",sad
 I know.,sad
" There's babies over there, though, that need mothers.",neu
" I'm not okay with it, but I don't-- it's not like I have a choice.  I don't see what crying about it is going to fix.",xxx
" Just, you know, kicking myself.",sad
 like you sign up because you need money and,xxx
 things just aren't what they seem.,sad
" We're doing the right thing, though.",xxx
" If not me then, who?",sad
" You'll videotape everything, yeah?",sad
" Maybe you can send it to me, like stream it, yeah?",sad
 Last month--  Yeah.,sad
 I have to find sitters.,neu
" We've got friends, that's why we moved here, huh?  Because there is a day care down the street.",sad
 And your mother is close by.,neu
 I'll send you lots of letters.,sad
 And I want lots and lots and lots of pictures.,sad
 It's not fair.,xxx
" I don't understand.  You've already done so much, I don't know why do you have to go back.",sad
" I don't know, it's just not fair.  I think you've already made your sacrifice.",xxx
 I just don't see how they can make you leave when you have a new baby - we have a new kid.,fru
 Then why is that fair?  Why--,xxx
 I don't know how you can be okay with this?  I don't know why you're not-- you're fine with it.,sad
 I'm just trying to think of another way.  I'm just trying to...,xxx
 This is a stupid war.,xxx
 I know.,fru
 I just don't see why it has to be you.,sad
 What am I going to do? Huh?,sad
 Yeah.,sad
 Don't you guys have access to computers over there.,neu
 I just don't know how I'm going to do it without you.,sad
 I can't raise a baby by myself.  How?,sad
 I know.,neu
 It's just not fair.,fru
 Well Vegas was awesome.,hap
" And, um, I got married.",hap
 Yeah.  In the old town part.,hap
 Chuck. [LAUGHTER],xxx
 Um- Yes.  It was very romantic.,hap
 It was at the slot machines.,hap
" Uhuh, uhuh.  He won big and he-and he realized that the only thing that would make it better was me as his bride.",hap
 Hey.  Let's get married and I said okay.,xxx
" Yeah.  Well.  You know, because he's leaving the next day.",hap
 But we're going to have a honeymoon cruise.,hap
 Oh.  I hadn't even thought about that.,hap
" He's not going to be a citizen, though.",xxx
 Oh.  Totally.,hap
 I guess I'll-  I guess I'll have an internet husband.[LAUGHTER],hap
 I have an internet boyfriend.  I guess I'll have to juggle the two.  Is that cheating?  I don't know. Hmm.,xxx
" Yeah, so [LAUGHTER] He's calling me now",exc
" He likes to keep tabs, you know.",hap
" Uh, I think seven hundred and fifty dollars.",neu
 Penny slots. That's what he plays.,neu
 Yeah.,neu
 Oh.,xxx
 Yeah.  We played Wheel of Fortune pennies.  It's like a giant thing with like-,hap
 Fifty bucks. Mmhmm.,neu
 Yeah.,neu
 Well so now we're married. We have cat children.,hap
" We renamed Brenda, Lumber Janet.",hap
 She needs a new name each state that we go into. [LAUGHTER],hap
 So what's up?  What's new?,neu
 Yeah.  I heard.,neu
 Shut up.  No- in Vegas?,sur
 Who did you marry?,exc
 Did you propose to you?,xxx
 Oh.  The Wheel of Fortune slots?,xxx
 He turned to you and was like...,neu
 [LAUGHTER] That's really romantic.,hap
 Yeah.,neu
" Does that mean that you're going to get citizenship, too, in- in England or whatever?",neu
 Yeah.  Think about that.,xxx
 Yeah.  But he'll have like a long visa.  Can you go visit then for a long time?,neu
" Oh, how are you going to do the long distance thing?  So wait, are you going to move there?",xxx
 Like you need another one of those.[LAUGHTER],hap
 Is that your phone?,hap
 He loves you.,hap
 How much did he win at the slot?,neu
 Really? Penny slots?,sur
 Wow.,sur
 I'm a big fan of the Wheel of Fortune quarters. But it just costs so much.  I don't know.,neu
" But the pennies always get you because you end up spending like, you know, fifty bucks.",neu
" like, wait, but it's just pennies.  You're like, wait a minute I'm on to you.",neu
 Awesome.,exc
 [LAUGHTER] Cat babies.,hap
 That's fair enough.,neu
" Uh, what?  Craig's List?  Oh the internet thing?",neu
 I don't know.  Isn't that-- that's all like escort services and things like that.,neu
" I don't know.  I mean I've been looking for so long that I just figured that--  I mean, I think things like Monster are a lot more reliable than just some random free board.",fru
 What kind of a job?,xxx
 Really?,xxx
 He just...,neu
 you know what?  I heard about that job.  I applied for that.,neu
 Yeah.  I saw a posting at the theatre.,fru
 He got it?,xxx
 Yeah.,neu
 What did he do?  What was so great?  I don't understand why they would pick him over me.,xxx
 A resume?,xxx
 No.,xxx
 I just- I mean I call people up and I tell them what I'm good at.,neu
 Yeah.,neu
 I don't like- I don't like sending things in the mail.  I don't want my information out there.,xxx
 I'm there in front of them.  I'm telling them what I'm good at.,fru
 Why?  It's a piece of paper.,fru
" I just don't want this paper trail, you know.  I just don't want things following me around, like-.",fru
" It's just-- You know, I've had this problem before.  You're not the first person to tell me that I need a resume but...",fru
 ..I just-..I just think it's kind of prejudiced and they are really discriminating against people who just aren't that way.,xxx
" That's baloney, that's baloney.",fru
 Please.,fru
 you think that you're better than me because I don't have a car?,fru
" You know, you're riding the bus, too.",fru
 Why?  What choice?,fru
 You're saving the environment. mmhmm,fru
 Interesting.  That's fantastic.,fru
 I'm not frustrated.,ang
 Who do you think you are?,ang
 You are so high and mighty.  I just--,ang
 Oh.  I'm saving the environment. I'm riding this car because I- I want to.,ang
" The bus, I'm riding the bus because I want to.",ang
 I can not-- you are not here by choice.  Nobody would ride this bus by choice.,ang
" Have you tried, uh, Craig's List?",neu
 Yeah.,neu
 No.  There's regular jobs on there.,neu
 Uh huh.,neu
 I'm just saying I have a friend that got a good job on it so I was just recommending it.,neu
 He's like a manager for a theatre.,neu
 He's like a house manager. Yeah.  It's a good job.,neu
 You did?,neu
 Yeah.,neu
 You've been looking for a job for a long time; that was a long time ago.  Right?,neu
 Hmm.,neu
 I don't know.  He had a really good resume I guess and--,neu
 Yeah.  Do you have a resume?,neu
 It's kind of helpful when getting a job.,neu
 Well maybe we should sit down some time and you can just tell me all the stuff that you have done and I'll write it out.,neu
" No.  You can- or you can just bring it in person.  But they need, generally, something to see, you know, what kind of what that you've done, what kind of--",neu
" Yeah.  But the piece of paper helps, too.",neu
" No.  But it has an outline, you know.",neu
" I know.  Okay.  Well, um. Maybe--",neu
 Yeah.,neu
" Okay, yeah.  I would imagine.",neu
" Well, sometimes you have to do things that you don't necessarily like to do to have a job. But the job affords you money, you won't have to be taking the bus right now.",neu
 maybe get a car.,neu
" I just, you know, think you should try a little harder maybe.",neu
 I didn't say that.,neu
" I am riding the bus, but by choice.",neu
" To save the environment, carpool.",neu
 Yes.  One less car at a time.,neu
 Mmhmm.,neu
" You know, you don't have to take out your frustration on me, you know, just because...",fru
 ...you can't get a job and refuse to have a resume.,fru
 I don't think I'm anyone.,neu
 I- I-I didn't-- okay.,neu
 What?  No.,xxx
 What? Oh.  So now you're...,fru
 you know what?  You don't have to take your anger and your hurt out on me.,fru
 Why not?,xxx
 Hi.,fru
 Yeah. This is the fourth line that I have been in.,fru
 I need my bag.,fru
" I flew in over three hours ago, I've been in four different lines.",fru
 I waited the entire baggage- I waited for the whole baggage carousel four times.  They told me to go to the next one.  I waited through that for three planes and now I'm here.,fru
 Nash.,fru
 No G.,xxx
 Yes.,fru
 Flight seven fourteen.,ang
" Am I going to be getting, like, free tickets, free mileage. When can I expect my bag here?",ang
" Oh, Are you kidding me?",xxx
 Is this a joke?,ang
" Are there candid cameras?  Is this that movie? There's that show, right?  Airplane, airline.",ang
 So you'll give me money and then I'll get my bag?,xxx
" You're kidding me, this is a joke.",ang
 Do you have any idea-- fifty dollars?  That's supposed to replace everything that I have?  Do you understand how much I have packed in there? Not only does it have sentimental value; it can't be replaced like that.  It was incredibly expensive.,ang
 We flew in from Paris.  I've been shopping for three weeks.,ang
 I don't care what you're freaking sign says.  Somebody- Somebody needs to replace everything I've got there and give me money for my inconvenience.,ang
 Do you understand who my husband is?,ang
" If you're- if you're- if you're looking for a lawsuit, baby, you've found it.",ang
 Oh-Oh.  It's a gift.  You're-You're helping me out here?,ang
 You are cruising for a bruising.  You are in so much trouble.,ang
 Who's in charge?  Who is the president of Jet Blue?,ang
 Because I probably know him.,ang
 Yeah.,ang
" I don't want money, I want my clothes.",ang
 What's your name?,ang
 Sean.  Great. Do you have a badge number or something?,xxx
 Okay.  I'll do that.,ang
 I don't think you have done everything you could do because I don't have my bag here yet.,ang
 A letter? I'll make a personal phone call.,ang
 Hi.  Thanks for waiting.,neu
 Can I help you?,hap
 Uh huh.,hap
 Okay.,neu
 Okay.,neu
 Okay.  Great.  I'm really sorry that you had to do that.  What's your last name?  Let's start there.,neu
 Okay.,neu
 all right- okay.  And you lost your bag? Is that- that the issue?,neu
 Uh-huh.,neu
" Yeah. Yeah, I don't see- I don't see any--",neu
" I don't see any record of it, and I-usually when I don't see a record of it, that means um-",neu
" we've mistakenly lost your baggage.  We're very sorry.  On behalf of Jet Blue I would like to apologize for any inconvenience.  I am allowed to issue you a fifty dollar gift card which you can use any future flights you want to take with us.  I'm very sorry, once again...",neu
" for such an inconvenience and your bag, but",neu
 Yeah.,neu
" No, no.",neu
" No, no.  This is real.",neu
" No.  I'm just giving you money, the bag is gone.  If it's not here, I'm really sorry there is nothing I can do because...",neu
 this is the only track record that we have and if it's not listed here then it's probably not anywhere.,neu
" Once again, I'm really- I'm really sorry.",xxx
 Yes.,neu
 I know.,neu
" I'm very sorry.  But if you see the sign that's right behind me here, it spells it out really clearly that we are not held liable--",xxx
 Okay. Calm-,neu
" Actually, we are not necessarily liable to give you- to even give you this fifty dollars so... it's actually- it's actually really",neu
" We are actually not even allowed--  you know, like we don't have to give you this fifty dollars.  We don't have to do that.",neu
 It's a gift.,neu
" You know, the airlines can not be held responsible for every bag of luggage that comes through here.",neu
 With the amount of--,neu
" Um, actually, I don't know. I don't know. Oh really?",neu
 Well then maybe you can just call him and he can give you more money.  But right now all I can do--,neu
" Right now all I can do is just give you this fifty dollars, I'm really sorry.",neu
 Oh.  My name is Sean. Hi.,neu
" Badge number?  Uh, no.  You can just take my employee number I guess.",sur
 Why?  Have I done something wrong?  Have I given you bad service?  I feel like I have done the best I could.,sur
" If you want, you can write a letter.  I can give you the address. Yes.  An angry--",neu
" Or you can make a phone call.  But I think a letter might be a little more-- in my impression, letters have more...",neu
 It's okay.,xxx
" No, no, no.",xxx
 No.,sad
 That's sweet.,neu
 Thank you.,neu
 I went to see her headstone a week or two ago.,sad
" I used to go to cemeteries a lot before she died.  I just, you know, I felt like they were urban oasis, you know, there is always this green in the city.",sad
 So I was like wandering around before.  It takes forever to find her headstone; I always lose it. You know.,sad
 So I was looking at this other one and there was like a piece of candy there and I thought that I would take the candy and put it on her headstone.  And-,sad
" this woman came up and, you know, it was hers. It was her person that was there.",neu
" Yeah.  And she was like, that's pathetic, I hope you enjoy it.",sad
" And I, you know, I mean, I said I was sorry and I brought it back to her kind of and I like put it on the ground and she was like, no, it's fine.  She was like, I would rather have her back, honestly.",sad
" I don't know.  It just, like, I felt so bad because I shouldn't have done it.  I don't know.  Whatever.",sad
 I don't know.,sad
 At the cemetery?,sad
 couple hours.,sad
" I brought- I brought Chuck with me. He went to Redlands, yeah, for the day.  We ran through the sprinklers.",neu
 It was hot.[LIPSMACK],xxx
 Yeah.  It's huge.  Redlands is an old city so they have lots and lots of stones.,neu
 Yeah.,neu
" It's weird.  Whenever I go back to town, I think of her.  I mean, it's like ... I mean we grew up together and she died when we were twenty one.  And yeah.  She had cancer, she had two brain tumors.",sad
" My best friend Heather.  She's got a- we have a- we built this like little--  There's a park, Prospect Park.  And there is like a garden section of it that we set up for her.",sad
 She used to have these poetry parties on Memorial Day.,sad
 Umm. Yeah.,sad
" And the last time before she died, I remember she couldn't really stand, umm...",sad
" But I mean she could, but it was- so it was kind of sitting at her feet holding her up and she had these poems she had memorized.  And I remember looking up, she had curly red hair and there was this palm tree right behind her and it was like a crown growing right out of her head.  It was cool.",sad
" Some, I guess.  She memorized this one, John Dunn, it's called, Death Be Not Proud. and-",sad
" There's another one, I can't remember.",neu
" I remember, too, when we were--  she died at U.C.L.A.  She had brain surgery and there was not much hope to begin with, but I gave blood for her surgery, her mom and I before, so we dropped her off in the waiting room and then we were giving blood and came back.  And she, in her wheelchair, like can hardly do anything, reciting her poetry for these people like in the waiting room.  All she needs is a God damn audience.  You know?",sad
" I'm sorry, Joy.",sad
 Is there anything I can get you?  Do you want me to take care of anything for you or...?,neu
 ...pick up anything?,neu
 You know you are welcome to stay at my house if you want to just check out for a couple days and hang out.,sad
 Hmm.,neu
 Oh.  She was there?,neu
 Mmhmm.,neu
 Yeah.,sad
 How long were you there for?,neu
 Mmhmm.,neu
 Oh really?,neu
 You ran through the sprinklers in the cemetery?,neu
 Is it a big cemetery?,neu
" Oh, so they're like really old too, really old ones?",neu
 Mmhmm.,neu
 Mmhmm.,neu
 So she wrote a lot of poetry?,neu
 Mmhmm.Mmhmm.Mmhmm.,xxx
" Yes.  There's a big envelope it says, you're in. I know.",exc
 So I have to move back to the ghetto but...I know.,xxx
" I'm really excited.  Yeah. I don't know how I'm going to pay for anything, but... I also- Yeah.  Loans, too, yeah. I applied, though, for a bunch of grants and scholarships so I'm still waiting to hear on that.",exc
" Oh- I know, I know, I know, I know.",exc
" I don't know.  I spend so much time commuting as it is, I'd rather.",exc
 I know. We should throw a party.,exc
" At Arapaho we could afford that. [GARBAGE]. Yeah.  So what are you doing this summer, though?  You're staying around, too, yeah?",xxx
 It's a relief too. I mean I was thinking I was going to have to pack up all of my stuff but yeah. Hooray for U.S.C.,xxx
" Umm. It's...It's uhh...It's Critical Studies. It's a really prestigious program, so they say.",xxx
 Yeah.  I'm not sure.,exc
 Umm...P.h.D. [LAUGHTER],exc
" Um, yeah, yeah.  I'm a TA for two sessions. Mmhmm.",xxx
 So I get to mold young minds. Mrs.?  That's my mother.,exc
" I would be like- Oh. Right, right, right.",exc
" Yeah. Yeah I'm excited. Hooray.  And then I'll be a millionaire once I graduate, you understand? Because that's the way it works.",xxx
 Yeah.  Totally. [LAUGHTER],xxx
" I know. I made such a mess of it, the entire time.  The last three things I've done, I've ruined everything, I think. Mm-hmm.  Yeah.",exc
 Did you get the letter?,exc
 Yeah. That is so awesome.,exc
 Oh my God. What are you going to do? [LAUGHTER],exc
" Oh-Yeah, I bet you're really excited. Oh.  That's what loans are for?  Right? Exactly.",exc
" Oh.  Good, good.  That's awesome. Are you going to stay around here?  Or are you going to like get a different neighborhood- you going to move to a different neighborhood?",exc
 This is so- I am so happy that you're going to stay.  You're not going to...We should totally throw a party.,exc
 A rapper party ho. Yeah. Okay.,exc
" I am just- Yeah.  I'm sticking around, I'm just doing my thing.  I'm living here.  I'm so glad you're going to stay, I'm so glad you're going to be here. Yeah. Woo.",exc
 Yeah.  Big time.,exc
 Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Yay. So what major?  What are you doing?,exc
" Oh, okay.",xxx
 Ooh. Fancy.,xxx
 Is this a Masters or a P.h.D.?  Or can you...? Nice,neu
" That's good.  Don't you have to like teach a class, too, when you do that?",neu
" Teacher. Mrs. Nash, I have a question.",exc
 You have to get married.  Well you are married to Chuck.  You're Mrs. Nash.  Not to be confused with Mrs. Dash which is the popular seasoning.,exc
" Mrs. Nash.  That's so awesome, though.",xxx
 Yay...School's fun.,exc
" Of course, right.  That's where the real money is, being a student.",neu
 That's how you get the big bucks.  Are you messing with the chair? Don't ruin it.,hap
 What's he going to say?,fru
 Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.,xxx
 How could he see it?  I was the first one up; he was still in bed.,sur
 When?,xxx
 What was he doing out here at four o clock in the morning?,xxx
" He's dreaming of him again, walking around.",neu
 It's getting to be just like after he died.  What's the meaning of that?,xxx
 What?,xxx
 What do you mean dishonest?,xxx
 What do you want to do?  Argue with him?,fru
 You can't say that to him.,fru
 Where's the proof?  Do you have any proof?,fru
" To you it is, to me it is, but to your father, you can talk yourself until you are blue in the face.  But there is no grave and there is no body, so where are you?",fru
" It's that the trouble is those God damn newspapers.  Every month some new boy comes back and so the next one is going to be Larry, they just--",xxx
 Why?,fru
" Well I got an idea, but what's your story?",neu
" Well that's only your business, Chris.",xxx
 Well what do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.,xxx
 Well you want to make sure that your father is not going to --,xxx
 I'm just saying.,xxx
 Oh.  I ignore what I got to ignore.  That girl is Larry's girl.,xxx
" From your father's point of view, he is not dead and- Chris he still thinks he's still alive.  The girl is Larry's girl.",fru
" Now you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I'm telling you, I don't know where to go.",fru
" You're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong in that.",fru
 I just don't see why.  Have you asked Annie yet?,fru
 Well how do you know she's going to marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way your father does.,fru
 The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.,fru
 Why does it have to be Annie?,fru
 Oh that's a great reason.  It's no reason at all.,fru
" You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years.",fru
 I don't want a diagram.,fru
 He thinks he's coming back Chris.,fru
" You marry that girl, you are pronouncing him dead...",fru
 ...and then what's that going to do to your father?  Do you know?  I don't.,fru
 Just give it some more thought.,neu
 What the hell is this?,ang
 Are you crazy?,xxx
 You have a business here.  What the hell is this?,ang
 Oh.  Must you be inspired?,ang
 You mean to tell me that you would leave the business over this?,fru
 Well you don't want to think like that.,fru
" All right.  But you don't want to think like that because what the hell are we working for, Chris?  It's all for you.  This whole shooting match is for you.",ang
 Just don't think like that.,ang
" I don't understand you, do I?",fru
 I can see that.,fru
 He saw it.,neu
 He was out here when it broke.,neu
 Four o clock this morning.  I heard a crack and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right over there when it cracked.,neu
 I don't know.,neu
 I guess he is.,neu
" I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing, Mom, you've made a terrible mistake with father.",fru
" Being dishonest with him, you know.  This kind of thing always pays off and it's paying off.",xxx
 You know Larry is not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,neu
 I don't want to argue but it's time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive.,fru
" You know?  Why shouldn't he walk the nights thinking of him, dreaming of him?   Do we contradict him?  Do we say, we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for years now?",fru
 We've got to say it to him.,neu
" For God's sake, three years?  Nobody comes back after three years; that's insane.",fru
" Sit down, Mom.  I want to talk to you.",neu
" All right, all right, all right.  You know why I asked Annie here, right?",fru
 You know.,neu
 I'm going to ask her to marry me.,neu
 You know it's not just my business.,neu
" So all right then, I'll just go ahead with it?",neu
 Then it's not just my business.,fru
" You know sometimes you infuriate me.  you know that?  Isn't it your business if I tell father and he throws a fit about it?  God, you have such a talent for ignoring things.",ang
 She's not Larry's girl.,fru
" I don't know why it is, but every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because I am afraid other people will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time.",fru
 To hell with that.,fru
 I wanted to get this settled first.,neu
" Well if she does, then that's it.  That's the end of it.  From her letters, though, I think she's pretty much forgotten him.",neu
 And then we'll thrash it out with father.  Okay Mom?  Don't avoid me.,neu
 So what.  I'm not fast with women.,fru
 Because it is.,fru
 I don't know.,fru
" I can't help it, I know her best.  I was brought up next door to her, you know?  These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie.",fru
" Mom, what do you want?  A diagram?",fru
" All right, then, Mom. [BREATHING]",fru
" I've given it three years of thought.  And I'd hope that if I waited, father would forget about Larry and then we could just have a regular wedding and everyone would be happy.",fru
" But if I can't do that here, I may have to go somewhere else.",fru
" I'll get out.  I'll get married and I'll move somewhere else, maybe New York.",neu
" I've been a good son for too long, a good sucker.",fru
 The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,fru
" Yes.  I like it for an hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long, when I come home I want it happy.",fru
" I want some kids, I want a family, I want somebody that I can give myself to and Annie is in the center of that.  Now it's just where to find it.",fru
" On this, I would.",neu
 Then help me stay here.,neu
 I know that.  Then just help me stay here.,fru
 Well I am thinking like that.,fru
 No.  You don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.,fru
 Why did he invite her here?,xxx
" She's been in New York three and an half years, why all of a sudden?",xxx
 Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,xxx
 He's not going to marry her.,ang
 It's got that about it.,ang
" What is going on here, Joe?",ang
 She is not his girl.  She knows she's not.,ang
" Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men, why is she still single?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she waited.",ang
" Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my darkest moments, I think of her waiting and I know that I'm right.",ang
" Nobody in this house dares take away her faith, Joe.  You know strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",ang
" I want you to-- I want you to act like he is coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since Chris invited her here.",ang
 I won't stand for any nonsense.,ang
" Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  Oh laugh, laugh all you like but why does this happen the very night he comes back.  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe, look.",ang
" Just believe with me, Joe. Only last week a man came back in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  Believe with me. You, above all, have got to believe. Just believe.",ang
 I can't help it.,fru
 Why does that bother you?,xxx
 Well maybe...maybe he just wanted to see her.,neu
" What do you mean?  You know he lived next door to the girl his whole life, why wouldn't he want to see her?",xxx
 [BREATHING] You don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anything more than he told you.,fru
 How do you know he's even thinking about it?,neu
 Oh.  So what.,xxx
 Now listen.,fru
 You can't read her mind.,fru
 How do you know why she waited?,neu
" Hey look, it's a nice day, huh?  Why are we arguing?",fru
 What do you want me to do? What do you want?,fru
 Kate.,fru
 [BREATHING],fru
 Calm yourself.,fru
 Okay. Calm yourself.,fru
" I know. All right, all right. All right. Okay.  Calm yourself. What does that mean, me above all?",fru
" Look at you, you're shaking.",xxx
" What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?",ang
 You're the only one who still loves his parents.,neu
 It's not so bad; it's a good thing.,neu
" [BREATHING] You know, it's lovely here.  The air is sweet.",neu
" I'm not sorry, no. But I'm...I can't stay.",neu
" For one thing, your mother much as told me to go.",neu
" And then, you.  You've been kind of...",neu
 Sort of embarrassed ever since I got here.,neu
 I knew they would.,neu
" Well sure, from your mother's point of view.  Why else would I come?",neu
" I, umm. I guess, I guess that's kind of why I came.",neu
 [BREATHING],hap
 [LAUGHTER],hap
 [LAUGHTER],hap
 No. No,hap
" Chris, I've been ready a long, long, time.",neu
 I almost got married two years ago.,neu
 You started to write me.,neu
 Every day since.,hap
" I was waiting for you, Chris.  You sure can be ambiguous, you know.  And when you did finally write me,",xxx
 beating around the bush.,hap
" I will never forgive you.  All I'd done was sit around wondering if I was crazy waiting so long, wondering if you were thinking about me.",hap
 Not like that you're not.,hap
" Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.",neu
" Chris, what is it?",xxx
 No. What is it?  Is it your mother?,xxx
" Then what?  Chris.  Even in your letters, there was something ashamed.",xxx
 You've got to tell me.,xxx
 It wouldn't work like this.,xxx
" Yeah, sure.",neu
 How many?,neu
" Aw, geez.",sad
 Mmhmm.,neu
 Do you still feel that way?,xxx
" Because you mustn't feel that way.  Everything you have, you've earned - everything.  you understand me?",xxx
" Even me.  And your money?  Chris, there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes into the air, you should be proud of that.  A man should be paid for that.",xxx
 What would I do with a fortune?,hap
" I know.  It kind of went out of style, didn't it?",neu
 You're not sorry you came.,neu
 Why not?,xxx
 Well.,neu
 What?,neu
 Well I was kind of planning of sneaking up on you over the course of a week or so.  They just take it for granted that we're all set.,neu
 You did?,xxx
" So would you want to?  I mean, I guess you have to know that's kind of why I asked you to come?",xxx
" I love you. Annie, I love you.",hap
" I don't really have any imagination, that's all I know how to say.",hap
" Am I embarrassing you? Are you - See, I didn't want to do it here with this yard, on this porch.  I wanted it to be somewhere new, some place fresh for both of us.",hap
" You feel uncomfortable here, you feel that it's wrong here somehow.  I just...I don't...I didn't want...I didn't want to take you away from anything.",xxx
 And he's gone forever?  Are you sure?,xxx
 Why didn't you?,xxx
 You felt something that far back?,sur
 Why didn't you let me know?,hap
 Give me a...,hap
 Give me a kiss.,hap
 God.  I kissed you Annie.,xxx
" Oh Annie, we are going to live now.  I am going to make you so happy.",hap
 I kissed you.,hap
" Hey, let's drive some place.  Huh?  Let's get out of here.",sad
 No it's nothing like that. It's-,sad
 Yeah.  I suppose I have been. But it's going from me.,sad
 I don't even know how to start.,sad
" It's just all mixed up with so many other things, you know?  You know overseas I was in command of a company?",sad
 Well I lost them.,sad
 Pretty much all.,sad
 You can't just toss off a thing like that because they weren't just men. You know?,sad
" Like for instance, there was this one time it had been raining for several days and this kid he just came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.  He just put them in my pocket.  That's a little thing, you know, but that's what kind of guys I had.",sad
" They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that, exactly.  Just a little more selfish and they would all be here today.",sad
" And I had this idea as I was watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed, you know, but this one thing was being made.  It was kind of a monument, it's kind of responsibility, man for man.",xxx
" To bring that on to the earth again, you know, is like some kind of monument and I thought I would just make a difference to them.",sad
" But then I came home and it was incredible, you know?  The whole thing was just kind of this random bus accident.  You know, I went back to the rat race again, I went to work.",sad
 Driving my new car and seeing a new refrigerator.,xxx
" I mean...You can't take those things out of a war. when you drive that car and you see that new refrigerator, you have to know that it came out of the love that a man can have for another man.",xxx
 And I didn't want any of it. I guess that included you.,sad
 I just want you to know Annie.,neu
" Annie, Annie.  I am going to make a fortune for you.",xxx
 Fine.,neu
 [BREATHING],fru
 What?,xxx
 What flashlight?,sur
 That's not your flashlight.,neu
 It's ours; it's my flashlight too.,xxx
 You keep saying my flashlight like it's just yours.,ang
 How's that supposed to make me feel?,ang
 Yeah.,neu
 [LAUGHTER],hap
 I'm cold.,sad
" It's after eleven, let's go.",xxx
 There is no point.,xxx
 That's my point.,xxx
" Well, then let's go.",fru
 Not particularly.,neu
 I just don't.  It's stupid.,xxx
" Pass what up?  I mean these fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the beach, they swim away and then they die.",fru
 I don't see why you're so excited; this isn't a freaking moon landing we are talking about.  It's fish.  It's a fish nobody even eats.,xxx
 Oh Augie,fru
 I'm just not.,xxx
 Yeah.,fru
" Last time, you'll also remember, we got our shoes wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat and we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions.",xxx
 Hmm.  We didn't see them the year before either.,fru
 That's the wind.,neu
 About what?,neu
" What time is it?  I think it's supposed to run around midnight, right?  God, this is great, isn't it, Carla?  Look at this night we got here, huh.",xxx
" Actually I want to get a little further up the coast, get away from all like the lights and the people, but...  How are you doing?",xxx
" Okay.  Is that, is that--",exc
 No.  That's just foam.  I don't know.  I can't tell.,xxx
" I don't know, probably if you can't tell, though, it's probably not them, right?  It's probably going to be like this unmistakable thing, right?",xxx
 Oh no.  you know what I forgot?,xxx
" My flashlight.  God, how could I be so stupid?  I can't believe I forgot my flashlight.",xxx
" The flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?",neu
 Whose is it?,neu
" Oh...well. Yeah, of course.",neu
 No.,neu
" Of course, our flashlight.  What's yours is mine.  Me flashlight es su flashlight.",neu
" Naturally.  God, how could we not think to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out, though.",fru
 Do they always run during a full moon?  I don't remember.  Was it full last year?,neu
" Huh.  Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  No?  you know, we should have brought the blanket?  Our blanket.",neu
" Aw.  Do you know, I should have brought a six pack, too.  A six pack, that would be just the ticket right about now.  Huh?",neu
" God, I'm so excited, I'm like a kid.  I can't believe I got out of the house with my fly zipped up.",exc
 I wonder if they can hear me talk or like feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around.,xxx
 Do you want my jacket?,fru
 What?  We just got here.  What's the point of coming all the way down here if we just turn around and go home?,xxx
 Right.,neu
" Wait, that's my point, too.",neu
" No, no.  Okay.  That's not my point.  My point is there is no point in coming down here if we just turn around and go home.  Don't you want to see it?",fru
 Why not?,neu
" Honey, this is like a natural phenomenon. I mean... People in Kansas would have to get plane reservations and get hotel rooms to see this.  It's just forty minutes away for us; it's too good to pass up.",neu
 Yeah.  But this..this moment on the beach is like the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what to do - spawning or mating or whatever.,neu
 This is a big night for these little guys.  It's like life's last orgy.,neu
 Yeah they do.,fru
" okay... well, Whatever.  But it's a fish who do something no other fish do.  It's like those swallows returning to Capistrano or like those lemmings that throw themselves off the cliffs.",xxx
" There's like mystery here, there's magic.  It's like a little bit of the unexplainable.  I just can't see how you're not interested.",neu
 For real?,sur
" God, I don't get it.  you know the first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life?",neu
" And last year, I remember distinctly you said, you were so excited to get here that you don't remember you stubbed your toe until we were in the car.",neu
 Ahh...we weren't in a good spot.,neu
" We just weren't in a good spot.  I'm telling you, this is a much better spot.  I have instincts for these things.",neu
" Look there, see?  What's that?  No, that's - that's just seaweed.",exc
" God, this is great.  Think about this.  I know you are not interested, but just think about this.",hap
" Right now out there, there is this mass of silver fish and it's heading this way.  No one sent them an invitation, no one told them, no one even gave them a map.",xxx
" Just all at once, they turned and they formed this line as long as the California coast.  And some instinctual little firecracker went off in their bodies and they all just turned as one and started swimming.",exc
 They are swimming right now.  They are swimming as if that is the only thing that matters to them.,xxx
 It's single mindedness with no mind.  It is urgency that is just pure urge.,exc
 And they are swimming right now to this very point where we stand for this huge celebration of sex and death.,xxx
" Oh look.  I'm giving myself goose bumps, my hairs are standing up on my arm.",xxx
 So what do you think?,hap
" About all of that, about all I was talking about.",hap
 That's the wind.,neu
 About what?,neu
 I think it's ridiculous.,xxx
 It's PR! Somebody sold you a bunch of crap that there is this wonderful thing that is going to happen tonight on the beach.,xxx
" Everybody's told the same story.  It keeps us coming back for more, it keeps us excited.  We keep thinking that life is going start at any minute if we can just find the right spot, get in on the action.",xxx
" I'm sorry, it's just fish to me.",xxx
" Don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that, you always ask me that.  It's insulting.",ang
 We just have different ideas of what this night is supposed to look like.,fru
" For God- Grow up, Augie.  The fish are not going to arrive.",ang
 Because they never do.  Have they...Have they ever?,ang
 Twice is every time we have tried; that's ever.,ang
 No they won't.  It's like waiting for Santa Claus.,xxx
 I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on this beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish never show up.,fru
 You don't understand anything I am saying.,fru
" I did want to see it, I still do, I always do.  I just...",xxx
" I feel like I'm always just standing here waiting.  I feel like this night is going to be the night, but it never is.",sad
" For God's sake, this is not about fish.",ang
 Do you remember the first year we came here?  It was like four years after we got married.,neu
" We thought I was pregnant, we got a bottle of champagne, we had no glasses.  We took off our shoes and you asked me to dance.",xxx
" You whispered the sweetest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.  And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, finally, I am as happy as I'm supposed to be.",hap
" Drinking champagne from the bottle,",xxx
 dancing barefoot in the sand.,fru
 I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.,sad
 No.,neu
 No.,xxx
" No, no. Nothing.",fru
 No.,neu
 No.,fru
 I just want something to turn out like I expected it to.,xxx
 [BREATHING],fru
 This? What is this?  This is nothing.  This isn't even anything.,fru
 Sure.  This is standing on the beach waiting.  This is fighting.,xxx
" I mean this is a lot of things, but it's just...",fru
 Do you understand what I am saying?,fru
" I know you are Augie, I know.",sad
" I know you meant this to be special, I know that you wanted it to be right, but I just can't help thinking that, I can't help wishing that I was somewhere else.",sad
 I didn't say that.,sad
" Don't be ridiculous.  Anything that- anything I am doing, I'd rather be doing it with you.",sur
 Yeah.  Don't you know that?,sur
 For Heaven's sake Augie.,xxx
" You're the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else.  Somebody who doesn't take things so seriously, who could enjoy herself.",sad
" So maybe we are in the wrong spot, but we are with the right person.",neu
" Hmm.  I noticed that, it's pretty. Big old white moon.",hap
" Augie, you bought refreshments.",hap
 I guess we don't need glasses.,hap
 I'm beginning to think this might be the right spot after all.,hap
" Augie, I'm sorry.",sad
 Or not.,neu
" Look at this, all of the hairs are standing up on my arm.",exc
" Well, so, what do you think?",exc
 About what I was saying.,neu
 It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,xxx
" Not just me, look at all of these people.",fru
" Are we talking about the same thing, here?",xxx
" Carla, can I ask you something?  Now, don't take this the wrong way, but are you on your period?",neu
" Well then, what's bugging you?",fru
" There is nothing to it; we come down here, the fish arrive, they flop around, they do their fish thing.  We go ooh, ah, look at the fish and we go home.",fru
 Why not?,fru
 We've missed them twice.,fru
 They'll show up this time.,fru
 I thought you wanted to see it.,xxx
 No. Of course not.,fru
" It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatized over.",fru
 Okay.  I'm trying to work this backwards and pinpoint the exact moment where we took a turn for the worst here.,fru
" Okay.  So you were fine during that phone call from Marge and then dinner was okay.  And doing the dishes was fine and then I was going to take a shower and you're watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight, do you want to go?  And I said, sure great, let's go.",neu
" Okay.  So I am putting out the pets, getting the car out of the garage.",neu
" Wait a minute, I got it.",xxx
" It's when we were driving past that Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, let's get some champagne.  I said no, time's a wasting or something like that.",neu
" That's what it is?  Right?  You want this to be like the other time, right?",fru
 Sure.  All right.  Okay.,neu
" Listen, do you want to dance?",neu
 Do you want me to go get some champagne?,neu
 Do you want to take off your shoes?,hap
 Then what?,xxx
 Do you want to get married again?,hap
 What?  What?  Do you want a divorce?,oth
 A vacation?,xxx
 Like a new carpet?  A poodle?  A back rub?  Ice cream?  A suicide pact?  What do you want?  What the hell do you want?,xxx
" Well welcome to the human race, huh?  Do you think I had some grand fantasy going that four years down the line we would come to this beach and be arguing over fish?  No.",xxx
" No I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all roses and peaches and the bills would just pay themselves.  And we'll have three, fat rosy cheeked children.  Huh, baby, the joke's on us.  Because you know what you get?",fru
 Do you know what you get?  You get this.,fru
 Yes it is.,neu
 Right,xxx
 [BREATHING],fru
 I'm doing the best I can.,fru
" Maybe if you were with someone else, too.",sad
 I just- I know I don't make you happy.,sad
 Yeah?,sur
" You know, actually now that you mention it, no I don't.",neu
" I don't know, it seemed like such a good spot to me.",fru
" We have a great view of the moon from here, though, huh?",neu
 [BREATHING],neu
 And look what I got here.,hap
 It's not champagne.,xxx
 [BREATHING],hap
 Do you want to go home?  Are you cold?,neu
" Shh.  If we're very quiet, the fish might come.",neu
 Or not.,hap
 Is it them?,fea
 Freda is the only one who knows we are here.  She wouldn't ring up.,fea
 It had to happen sooner or later.  What are we going to do?,fea
" Now and always, sweet.",xxx
 It had to happen sooner or later.,xxx
 [LAUGHTER] That sent shivers up my spine.,hap
 We'll behave exquisitely.,exc
 I think I shall do a curtsy.,exc
 Hmm.  The pity is that one can't stay happy.,xxx
 It's true.  I think the whole thing's a cruel joke.,xxx
 Yes.  Meaning just that.,hap
 Don't laugh at me.  I'm being serious.,hap
 Who's they?,exc
" you know if I laugh at everything then I must laugh at us, too.",xxx
" How long with it last, this ludicrous overbearing love of ours?",xxx
 Shall we always want to bicker and fight?,xxx
" Oh dear, should we like that?",xxx
 What happens if one of us dies?  Does the other one still laugh?,xxx
" Well that's serious enough, isn't it?",xxx
 I think you are talking nonsense.,xxx
 [LAUGHTER],hap
" Oh Elliott, worms don't pop.",hap
" Aw.  Thank you, darling.  The same applies to you too, except that if you so much as look at another woman I'll kill you.",hap
 Which particular one?,xxx
" Oh Charles, that was his name.  He did wiggle so beautifully.",exc
 I know you did.  You threw him out the window into the Grand Canal.  I'll never forgive you for that.,xxx
 It went on intermittently for days.,xxx
" Oh And it burnt my comb, too, and all of those towels in the bathroom.",xxx
 [LAUGHTER] That was the first time you hit me.,xxx
" The manager came in, he found us rolling about the floor, biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER]  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.",hap
 [LAUGHTER] And very much sillier.,hap
 Oh.  You knew there was nothing in that.,xxx
 Good God.,fea
 I wonder.,fea
 It must be them then.,fea
 [BREATHING],fea
" We are okay, aren't we darling?",xxx
 I don't care then.,exc
" Hello?  Hello?  I'm sorry, what's that?",xxx
 No.  Wrong number. [LAUGHTER],hap
 What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us.[LAUGHTER],hap
 With perfect poise.,hap
" It's strange; things that ought to matter dreadfully, they just don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they?",hap
" Darling, don't say that.",xxx
 What?  This beautiful and sacred thing - love?,xxx
" Well what does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?",hap
" Oh darling, you mustn't be serious.  It's just what they want.",xxx
" All of those futile moralists who make life unbearable.  You have to laugh at them, be flippant.",xxx
" You know, flippancy brings out the acid in their darned, light and sweetness.",xxx
 Oh of course.  We are figures of fun.  All right.,xxx
 Who knows?,hap
 Oh no.  That fire will fade along with our passion.,xxx
 Well it depends on how well we've played.,xxx
 Yes.  Yes with all of his might.,exc
" No, no, no, no. no.  Death is a very laughable thing.  It's a cunning little mystery, it's all done with mirrors.",xxx
" Oh.  So is everyone, in the long run.",xxx
" Let's be superficial, and just pity those poor philosophers, huh?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party for as long as we can, you know, like small, idiotic school children.",exc
 Oh Come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets.,hap
" Oh See, I don't care what you do, see.  You can paint yourself green and run naked through the Place Vendome and run off with all of the men of the world.  I shan't say a word, just as long as you love me best.",hap
 Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,xxx
 The one where you put that tiny painted wooden snake in my bed.,xxx
 [GARBAGE],xxx
 It was a terrible thing.  I hated it.,dis
 How long did that row last?,xxx
 Uh huh.,xxx
 But the worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.,xxx
" That was a rouser, wasn't it?",hap
 I did not hit you very hard.,xxx
 [LAUGHTER] I'll never forget his face. [LAUGHTER],hap
 [LAUGHTER] We were very much younger then.,hap
 However I believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.,xxx
 And very much sillier.,hap
 Oh.  You knew there was nothing in that.,hap
" Presents?  It was only a trivial, little brooch.",hap
" It was not.  I still have it, and I wear it often.  It is very pretty.",xxx
 I did not.  You worked that whole thing up in your jealous imagination.,neu
" Well, what of it?",neu
 It gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.,xxx
" If you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.",xxx
 Oh dear.  I'm bored with this conversation.,fru
 No.  Thank you.,xxx
" I don't know why you'd want any, you've already had three glasses.",xxx
 I just think it's silly to go on and on and on about such a thing.,xxx
 It's become a habit with you.,xxx
 Don't be stupid.,ang
 What?,ang
 No.  I am just making myself fascinating for you.,ang
 Oh.  It's a woman's duty to allure the man.,ang
 No it isn't.,ang
 You shut up.,ang
 It's funny it hasn't worked such wonders for you.,xxx
" Adders don't snap, they sting.",xxx
 They sting. I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care if they bark and they roll about like hoops.,ang
" Yes I did, quite a lot.",ang
 Mind your own business.,ang
" You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you are drunk.",ang
 You've always had a weak head.,ang
" On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",ang
 Oh shut up.,ang
 Shut up.,ang
" Not very funny, darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy.",ang
 Why?,neu
 There are no people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.,neu
 They are away in Tunis.,neu
" Turn it on again, please.",xxx
 Fine if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.,ang
" You are far too temperamental, try to control yourself.",ang
" I won't.  Let go, let go of me. Listen, listen?  I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.",ang
" Oh shut up.  Let go.  I hate you, I hate you.  Do you hear?  You are a conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.",ang
 This is the end.  Do you hear me?  Finally and forever.,ang
 Oh.  Yes I am.,ang
" Yes I am.   Stop it. Stop it.  Let go of me. Oh.  You're a cruel fiend.  I loathe and I hate you. Marry you again?  Never, never, never. I hope you die in torment, you brute beast cad.",ang
 We were very much younger then.,xxx
 However I believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.,neu
 I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.,neu
" It was bristling with diamonds.  In the worst possible taste, too.",xxx
 You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,neu
" Well, you let him kiss you, huh?  You said you did.",fru
 What of it?,xxx
 What about me?,ang
" That's a nice point of view, I must say.",xxx
 So am I.  I'm bored stiff. [GARBAGE]  Do you want some brandy?,fru
" I'll have a little, I think.",neu
" No particular reason.  Anyhow, they are very small ones.",neu
" You can hardly call three glasses of liquor a whole evening long, going on and on and on.",fru
 Oh.  Don't be so grand.  Just because you don't happen to want one at the moment.,fru

 I think I am not in the least bit drunk.,ang
 I think I mentioned once before that I've had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A child of two cannot get drunk on that.,ang
" That's very interesting Amanda. How about a child of four?  Or a child of six?  Or a child of nine? We can get a good little conversation going on about this, you know, intemperate tots.",ang
 [LAUGHTER] That's a very good idea.  I think I will.,xxx
" Look, you better turn that off. I don't want to wake up the people upstairs.",ang

" I have it right here, yes.",fru
 But that's...,fru

 But they got to like drive around in a bus--that would suck.,xxx
 Yeah we have like away games and stuff.,neu
 They're nice.,xxx
" Like, you know like police officers, like--kind of heavyset guys. Mustaches, yeah. It's that kind of-",xxx
 That kind of...They're okay.  No I'm like- I'm kind of like the odd man out I'm like...,xxx
 But you know I'm like [GARBAGE].,neu
 Yeah.,xxx
 I'm going to have a mustache...On the force...,hap
 Pull over..,hap
 What he's going to say?,fru
 When?,sur
 How could he see it?  I was the first one up and he was still in bed.,sur
 What was he doing here at four in the morning?,sur
 Did you talk to him?,sad
 Cried hard?,sad
 [BREATHING],sad
 What is he doing out here at that hour?,fru
" He's dreaming about him again, walking the streets.",ang
 It's getting to be just like after he died.  What is the meaning of that?,xxx
 What?,sur
 What do you mean a mistake?,ang
" What do you want to do, argue with him?",fru
 You can't say that to him.,xxx
" What, can you prove it?  What proof do you have?  Can you prove it?",ang
" To you it is, to me it is.  But to your father?  You can talk yourself 'til you're blue in the face but there's was no grave and there is no body.  So where are you?",ang
 The trouble is those god damn news papers.  Every month some boy comes back missing longer then Larry so--,ang
 Why?,ang
" Well, I've got an idea but what's the story?",xxx
" Well, that's only your business, Chris.",fru
" Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough known your own business.",ang
 You want to make sure that your father's not going to...,xxx
 I'm just saying.,fru
 I'm sorry.  I ignore what I've got to ignore. That girl is Larry's girl.,ang
" From father's point of view he is not dead and you have no right to take his girl.  I'm just saying that you can go on from there if you know where to go but I'm saying I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.",ang
 You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that.,neu
 Did you ask Annie yet?,neu
" Well, how do you know she's going to marry you?  Maybe she feels same way your father does.",fru
" The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did.",fru
 I don't see why it has to be Annie.,ang
" That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years.",ang
" He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl you're pronouncing him dead.",sad
" Do you know what that'll do to you, to your father, do you know?  I don't.",ang
 Give it some more thought.,xxx
 What the hell is this?,sur
 Are you crazy?,ang
 You have a business here.  I said what the hell is this?,ang
" Oh, must you be inspired.",ang
 You mean to tell me you would leave the business for this.,xxx
" Well, you don't want to think like that.",ang
" All right but you don't think like that because what the hell is this all for.  This is all for you, what are we working for Chris? The whole shooting match is for you.",ang
" Well, you don't think like that.",ang
" I don't understand you, do I?",ang
" Well, I can see that.",ang
 He saw it.,neu
 He was out here at four this morning.,xxx
 I was out here at four this morning I heard a crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right over there.,neu
 I don't know.  But he went back in the kitchen and he cried.,sad
 No.  I figured I'd just let it wait.,sad
" Yeah, I could hear him crying through the floorboards in my room.",sad
 I don't know.,sad
 I guess he is.,sad
 I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know we've made terrible mistake with father.,fru
" I mean, these kinds of things, man they always come back at you.  And this is definitely coming back to us.",xxx
" I just--why shouldn't he walk the nights waiting for him, huh?  Do we contradict him do we say we don't have any hope any more that he's not coming back?",fru
" I don't want to argue with him, it's just for God's sake it's time he realized that no one believes with him any more.",fru
 I got to.,fru
" For God's sake, three years?  Nobody comes back after three years. It's insane.",fru
" Okay, all right.  Mom, sit down.  I want to talk to you.",fru
" Yeah, okay all right, all right.  Listen, um, you know why I asked Annie here, right?",fru
 You know.,xxx
 I'm going to ask her to marry me.,neu
 You know it's not just my business.,fru
 So it's okay then?  I'm just going to go ahead with it?,fru
" See.  Then it's not just my business. Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  You know it's just your business too if I tell father and he throws a fit about it, huh?",ang
 She is not Larry's girl.,ang
 I don't know why it is you know every time I reach out for something I have to pull back 'cause I'm afraid it's going to hurt somebody.  All my life...,fru
 To hell with that.,ang
" No, I wanted to get this all sorted out first.",sad
" Well, if she does then that's the end of it.  However from her letters I think she's pretty much forgotten him.",xxx
 So what?  I'm just--I'm not fast with women.,fru
 Because it is.,fru
" I don't know, it I think of her, I grew up next to her.  She is what I think of when I think of a wife.",fru
 All right then.,xxx
 I've given it lots of thought.  And I keep coming back to the same thing.,fru
" When I think of a family, when I think of my future I see Annie in the center of that and you know and if that can't happen here then I'll go somewhere else.",fru
 I'll leave.  I'll get married and move somewhere else maybe New York.,fru
 I'll do it.,xxx
 Business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,ang
" Yes, yes I like it for one hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long when I come home I want it nice, I want a family, I want to kids and Annie is in the center of that.",ang
 If that can't happen here...,fru
" Yes, on this I would.",neu
 Then help me stay here mom.,sad
" I know, I know.",xxx
 Then help me stay.,sad
 I am thinking like that.,ang
" No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.",sad
 Why did he invite her here?,ang
 It's been three and a half years.  Why all of a sudden?,ang
 He's not going to marry her.,xxx
 it's got that about it.,xxx
" What is going on here, Joe?",ang
 The girl is not Larry's.  If the girl is Larry's girl she's not his she know she's not.,ang
 Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men probably a hundred people told her she is crazy but she is waited.,xxx
 Because she knows what I know that's why.  She's faithful as a rock. in my darkest moments I think of her waiting and I know that I'm right.,xxx
" Nobody in this house dares take away her faith Joe.  Her- strangers might but not her father, not her brother.",fru
" I want you to---act like he is coming back.  Don't think I haven't noticed you, both of you since Chris invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.",ang
 Because if he's not coming back then I'll kill myself.,xxx
" Oh, laugh at me, laugh all you like but why does this happen to very night she comes back?  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe look.",ang
" Believe with me Joe, you got to believe. Only last week a boy came back missing longer then Larry you read it yourself.",ang
 You above all have got to believe. Just don't stop believing.,ang
 I can't help it.,xxx
" Well, maybe he wanted see her.",neu
" Well uh, He grew up next door to the girl, why wouldn't he want to see her?",neu
 Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anything he told you.,fru
 How do you know he's even thinking about it?,fru
 Oh so what?,fru
" Okay, now listen, kids...",fru
 Listen. Line. You can't read her mind.,fru
 And how do you know why she's waited.,neu
" Okay, look it's a beautiful day.  Why are we arguing?",fru
 What do you want me to do?  What do you want?,fru
 Kate...,fru
 [BREATHING],fru
" All right, calm yourself.",fru
" Okay, calm yourself. Alright.",fru
 calm yourself.,fru
 What does that mean? Me above all? What does that mean?,ang
 Look at you. You're shaking.,ang
" What the hell do you want from me, Kate?",ang
 The only one I know still love his parents.,neu
 Oh it's not bad thing it's good thing.,neu
" You know it's nice here, the air is sweet.",xxx
" Not sorry, no.  I can't stay here.",sad
 For one thing your mother as much as told me to go.,neu
 [BREATHING] And then you've been kind of...,sad
 You've been kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.,sad
" I knew they would, your mother anyway.",xxx
 From her point of view why else would I come?,neu
 Well I guess that's why I came.,xxx
" Chris,",xxx
" I've been ready a long, long time.",xxx
 I almost got married two years ago.,neu
 You started to write me.,xxx
 Everyday since.,exc
" Because I was waiting for you, Chris.  Till then you never wrote me and then when you did, well, you sure can be ambiguous you know.",exc
 I'll never forgive you for waiting so long.  All I did was sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking about you.,hap
" Like Larry's brother.  Do what like you, Chris.",xxx
" Chris, what's the matter?",sad
" No, what is it?  Is your mother?",sad
" Well, then what?  You know, even in your letter you seem kind of ashamed.",xxx
 You got to tell me.,sad
 Wouldn't work like this.,sad
" Yeah, sure.",sad
 How many?,sad
 [BREATHING]. Geez.,sad
 Do you still feel that way?,sad
" 'Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Everything you have, you have a right to...",xxx
 Everything Chris do you understand that?  To me too...,xxx
 And your money there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes into the air.  You should be proud of that a man should be paid for that.,xxx
 What would I do with a fortune?,hap
" Yeah, that kind of went out of style didn't it?",hap
 You're not sorry you came?,hap
 Why not?,sad
 Well.,xxx
 What?,neu
" I was kind of planning on sneaking up on you, you know over like a course of a week or so. They just take for granted that we're already set.",xxx
 You did?,neu
 Yeah--,neu
" So then would you want to?  I mean I guess, you kind of have to know, maybe that's why I asked you to come.",xxx
" Ann, I love you.  I love you.",hap
 I love you a great deal.,xxx
 I'm sorry I don't really have much of an imagination.,xxx
" I'm sorry I'm embarrassing you, aren't I?  See, I didn't want to do it here I didn't on this porch, with this ring--I didn't want to win you away from anything.",xxx
 So then he's gone.  You sure?,xxx
 Why didn't you?,neu
 You felt something that far back?,xxx
 why didn't you let me know?,exc
" Oh Annie, why don't you go ahead and give me a kiss, come on just a...",xxx
 I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.,exc
 I kissed you.,hap
 Do you want to go somewhere?  Let's go.,sad
" No, no, it's nothing like that.",sad
 I don't know it's--it's complicated. But it's going from me now.,sad
 I don't know.,sad
 It's kind of all mixed up with all these other things.,sad
 you know over seas I was in command of the company?,sad
 Well I lost them.,sad
 Pretty much all.,sad
" Takes awhile to toss something like that off.  I mean they weren't just men, you know.",sad
" For instance, there was this one time when this kid--it had been raining for like several days and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.",sad
 He just put it in my pocket that's the kind of guys I had.,sad
" They didn't die they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly, you know a little more selfish and they'll all be here today...",sad
" And I had this idea as I was watching them go down like everything was being destroyed, you know.  But I felt like this one new thing was being made, you know it's kind of like this.  This monument...",sad
" You know, that they were bringing something on to this earth, a kind of sacrifice you know.",sad
" I thought I would change everything you know, and I got back here and it was- it was like nothing had changed at all...",sad
 You know.  I went to work with dad and I started that whole rat race again...,sad
 And no one had changed it was just like sort of random bus accident to them.,sad
 Driving my new car and I felt guilty you know opening my bank book seeing a new refrigerator.,sad
 'Cause you can take those things out of a war.  But you have to realize that those things came out of the love that a man can have for another man...,sad
 And if you can't see that then it's just loot and there's blood all over it.,sad
 I felt ashamed and I didn't want any part of it.  I guess I included you too.,sad
 I want you to know Annie.,sad
 Annie...,xxx
 I'm going to make a fortune for you.,hap
 I'm fine.,xxx
 Ugh...,fru
 What flashlight?,sur
 That's not your flashlight.,xxx
" It's ours; it's my flashlight, too.",xxx
" You keep saying ""my flashlight"" like somehow it's just yours. How's that supposed to make me feel?",ang
 Yeah.,xxx
 No.,neu
 I'm fine.,neu
 I wonder if they can hear me talk,hap
 I'm cold.,fru
" It's after eleven, let's go home.",fru
 There is no point.,fru
 That's my point.,fru
 Then let's go.,ang
 Not particularly.,xxx
" I just don't, it's stupid.",xxx
" Pass what up?  These little fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the sand then they swim back and then they die.",ang
" I don't know what you're so excited about.  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about, it's fish, it's a fish nobody even eats.",fru
" Oh, Augie.",fru
 I'm not.,fru
 Yes.,ang
" Last year, you'll also remember we got--our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions.",ang
 We didn't see them the year before either.,ang
 That's the wind.,xxx
" What time is it?  God, this is great, isn't it?  I can't believe it.",exc
" Of course I did want to a little further up the coast you know get away from all the lights and people and everything.  Is it midnight, do they always start at midnight?  Is that what it is midnight?  How you doing, huh? You okay?  That's good.",exc
" Look, there what's that, what's that?  Is it--",exc
" No, I think that's just foam.",xxx
" Oh, no I can't tell though.  Although probably if you can't tell it probably isn't them right, yeah.  Probably going to be like unmistakable, right?",exc
" Gosh, this is great, isn't it?  This is awesome.  Oh, no you know what I forgot?",exc
 My flashlight.  How could I forget my flashlight?  God--,xxx
 Flashlight the silver one.  There's only one isn't there?,neu
 Whose is it?,xxx
" Oh, well, yeah of course.",neu
" Of course, our flashlight.  What's your is mine, mi flashlight es su flashlight.",neu
" Gosh, I should have brought it. I can't believe I forgot that.",neu
" It's a nice moon though, should stay full.  Do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember was it full last year?",xxx
 Are you all right?  Are you okay?  You cold?  Do you want to my jacket? My jacket? No?,xxx
" You know what we should've brought a blanket too.  Man, our blanket, our blanket.  Wish I had six-pack too, a six-pack would be just the ticket right about now, huh, six-pack.",exc
 What's wrong?  Are you okay?  Huh?  You cold?,xxx
" Oh yeah, I'm so excited right now I'm like a kid.",exc
 I can't believe I got out of the house without my fly zipped up even.,exc
" I wonder if they can hear me talking, you know.",xxx
 Like feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around.,xxx
 Do you want my jacket?,fru
 What are you kidding?  We just got here.  We don't want to turn around and go home now.  What's the point coming all the way down here?,fru
 Right.,neu
 That's my point too.,neu
" No, wait no, no that's not my point.  My point is there is no point and coming all the way down here if we just turn around and go home.",fru
 Don't you want to see it?,xxx
 Why not?,fru
 It's not stupid.  It's a natural phenomenon.,fru
 People in Kansas would have to get plane tickets and make hotel reservations to see this.  It's only forty minutes away; it's just too good to pass up.,ang
 Yeah but that like flopping around is what to do it's like spawning or mating or something.  This is like the highlight of their little fish lives.  It's like life's last orgy.,xxx
" Yeah, they do.",neu
" Well, okay whatever, okay but it's a fish who do something that like no other fish do, you know, it's like those swallows that return to Capistrano or those like those lemmings that jumped off the cliffs, you know.",exc
" It's like a little bit of the unexplainable, a little magic, a little mystery.  I just don't see how you can not be interested in this.",exc
 For real?,xxx
 All right.,fru
" I don't get it though, I mean the first time we came here you said it was like the best night of your life...",fru
 And last year I remember like distinctively you were so excited to get here that you didn't realize you stubbed your toe until we were in a car.,fru
 We just weren't in a good spot though.,neu
 We just weren't in a good spot I'm telling you this is a much better spot.,xxx
" Come on, trust me I got instincts for these things, okay?  So just--just think about it all right?  Okay, I know you're not interested, think about it...",neu
" Out there, there's like this big mass of silver fish they're heading this way...",exc
" They don't know why, we don't know why.  No one like sent them an invitation or gave them a map or direction...",exc
 They just all turned at once and they just form this line as long as the California coast.  And they just started swimming...,exc
 Like some little time release fire cracker went off inside their little tiny bodies.  And they all turned as one...,exc
" And form the line and started swimming, swimming that would bring them to this point here...",exc
 It's like urgency that's pure urge you know.  It's single-mindedness with no mind.,exc
" It's crazy.  Look at this, I'm giving myself goose bumps, the hairs are standing up on my arm.",exc
 That's the wind.,neu
 About what?,xxx
 I think it's ridiculous.,fru
 It's a PR.,fru
 Somebody sold you a bill of goods that something amazing is going to happen on the beach.,xxx
 They're all told the same thing.,fru
" Everybody is believes that it keeps them excited, you know it keeps them coming back for more.",fru
" Everybody keeps thinking that they can just find the right spot, you know they'll get it on the action.",fru
 Their life will start then.,fru
 I'm sorry it still just fish to me.,fru
" Why do you ask me that?  God damn it, I told you not to ask me that I hate it when you ask me that. It's insulting.",ang
" I just, we just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.",ang
" Oh. Grow up Augie, the fish are not going to come.",fru
" Because they never do.  Do they, have they ever?",ang
 Twice is every year we've tried that's ever.,ang
 No we won't.  It's pointless it's like a waiting up to see Santa Claus.,ang
" I feel like my whole life is going to be spent here on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly, waiting for fish to show up and the fish never show.",ang
 You don't understand anything I'm saying.,fru
" I did want to see it I still do, I always do.  I keep thinking that this time will be the time but it just never is.",xxx
 Do you remember the first year we came here? It's about four years ago right after we got married.,neu
 We thought I was pregnant we had this bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance so we took off our shoes.,xxx
" While we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me, right into my ears so I could feel them much as hear them.",xxx
" And I remember thinking this is it. finally, finally I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.",sad
" Dancing on the beach barefoot, drinking champagne from the bottle.",xxx
 I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.,sad
 No.,sad
 No.,sad
 No.,xxx
 No.,fru
 No.,fru
 I want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to.,ang
 This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.,ang
" Oh, sure this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, fighting.",ang
 This isn't anything like I thought anything would be.,sad
 This is just this.  I mean it includes a lot and everything but it's--do you understand what I'm saying?,sad
" I know that Augie, I really do.",sad
" I just can't help wishing that I was somebody, somewhere else.",sad
 I didn't say that.,sad
 Are you kidding me?  For heaven sake Augie anything I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you.,sur
" Yes, don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?",sur
" You are the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else, someone who didn't take everything so seriously, someone who would enjoy yourself.",sad
 So maybe we're in the wrong spot.  But we're with the right person.,xxx
 Oh I saw that.  Pretty isn't it. Big ol' white moon.,xxx
" Augie, you brought refreshments.",xxx
 I guess we don't need glasses.,hap
 I'm beginning to think you might be right.  I think this might be the spot after all.,hap
" Augie, I'm sorry.",sad
 Or not.,neu
 They're out there swimming right now...,xxx
 ...to this spot for this massive celebration of like sex and death...,exc
" Look at this, my hairs are standing up my arm. I'm giving myself goose bumps.",exc
" Well, so?  What do you think?",exc
 About what I was saying.,xxx
 It certainly is not.  It's like slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,xxx
" It's not just me, okay?  Look at like all the people.",fru
 Are we talking about the same thing?,xxx
 Can I ask you a question?  Are you on your period?,neu
" Okay, well then what's bugging you?",xxx
" Is not supposed to like anything.  We come down here, we look at the fish, they arrive, we go woo-ah fish.",fru
 And then we go home and they go home.,xxx
 Why not?,fru
 We missed them twice.,neu
" Okay we'll see them this year, this is a much better spot. Trust me.",fru
" Okay, I'm trying to work this backwards",fru
 and figure out where we took a turn to the worst thing.,fru
 Of course not.,fru
" Okay.  I'm trying to work this backwards here and I'm trying to figure out the exact moment that you took a turn for the worst here, now.",fru
" you were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was fine.",neu
" Let's see, uh, I took a shower and, um, you were watching the news and you said the ""the Grunions are running tonight,"" and I said ""okay great, let's go.""",neu
 So I'm putting the animals out we're getting the car to the garage and--,neu
" Wait a minute, I've got it.",neu
" It was when we were driving passed that knickerbocker liquor locker and you would said, no you said ""let's get some champagne"" and I said ""no time to wasting"" or something like that.  That's what it is, right?",neu
" You want this to be like the other times, right?",xxx
" Oh right sure, of course.",neu
 Do you want to dance?,xxx
 You want me to go get some champagne?,neu
 Do you want to take off our shoes?,neu
 What? Huh?,neu
 You want to get married again?,neu
 What?  What?  You want to divorce?,fru
 A vacation?,fru
" A new carpet, a poodle, a suicide pact, ice cream, a back rub, what?  What?  What the hell do you want?",ang
" Well, welcome to the human race.",fru
 You think nothing turns out how it's supposed to.  You think I had some grand idea going that four years down the line.  We would come to this beach and argue over fish?  No.,ang
" You think there would be times when you'd look at me like I was used Kleenex and then I'd look at you and think ""Holy hell when is the next flight to Alaska.""",xxx
" No, no I'm just like you, I thought it was going to be all rosy cheeks and the bills would pay themselves and fish will always come and--",sad
 No.  You know what you get?  You know what you get?  You get this.,sad
" Yeah, it is.",neu
 Right.,neu
 I know me neither.,sad
 I'm doing the best I can.,sad
 Maybe if you were with somebody else too?,sad
" No, I know but--I know I don't make you happy.",sad
 Yeah?,sad
" Actually, you know what?  Now you mentioned that--no I don't.",xxx
" I don't know, just seemed like such a good spot to me.",xxx
 We do have really good view of the moon from here though.,xxx
 Look what we got here.,hap
 It's not champagne.,neu
" Are you cold, huh?  Do you want to go home?",neu
 Shh...,hap
" If we are really quiet, the fish might come.",hap
 Or not.,neu
 Do you think it's them?,xxx
 Freda is the only one who knows we are here. She wouldn't ring up.,fea
 What we're going to do?,fea
 Now and always sweet.,hap
 It had to happen sooner or later.,hap
" Oh, oh, that sent shivers on my spine.",xxx
 Oh...,xxx
 [BREATHING],exc
 Oh. Behave exquisitely...,hap
 [LAUGHTER] I think I shall do a court curtsey.,hap
 [LAUGHTER],hap
 Mmm...,hap
 The pity is that one can't stay happy.,xxx
 It's true.  I think the whole things a very poor joke.,xxx
" Oh, yes meaning just that.",hap
 [LAUGHTER] Don't laugh at me I'm being serious.,hap
 Oh whose they?,xxx
" Mmhmm If I must laugh at everything, I must laugh at us too.",hap
" How long will it last, this ludicrous, overbearing love of ours?",hap
 Shall we always want to bicker and fight?,hap
" Oh, will we like that?",xxx
 If one of us dies...,hap
 does the one that's left still laugh?,xxx
" Well, that's serious enough isn't it?",xxx
 I think you're talking nonsense.,hap
 Hmm.,xxx
 Ah.,xxx
" Oh, Elliot.  Worms don't pop.",xxx
" Oh, thank you darling.",xxx
" The same applies to you too, except you so much as look at another women I'll kill you.",xxx
 Which particular one?,hap
" Oh, Charles.  That was his name Charles. He did wriggle so beautifully.",exc
" Oh I know you threw it out the window and into the Grand Canal.  Oh, I'll never forgive you for that.",xxx
 It went on intermittently for days.,xxx
 Cannes...mmhmm...,hap
 Oh it burnt my comb too and all those towels in the bathroom.,xxx
 The manager came in he found us rolling about the floor.  [LAUGHTER],hap
 Scratching and biting like panthers. [LAUGHTER] Oh...,hap
" Utterly, utterly ridiculous.",hap

 Very much sillier.,hap
 Oh you knew there was nothing in that.,exc
 Good God.,fea
 I wonder.,fea
 Must be them then.,xxx
" We're okay, right darling?  Whatever happens, we're okay?",fea
 I don't care then.,hap
 Yes... Hello?  Hello?  I'm sorry what's that?,xxx

 What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?,xxx
 With perfect poise...,hap
 Ah...,hap
 Ah...Strange...,hap
" Things that just ought to matter dreadfully, you know they just don't matter at all when one is happy, do they?",hap
" Darling, don't say that.",sad
" What, this sacred and beautiful thing, love?",xxx
" Oh, dear god what is that all mean, dear god?",hap
" You mustn't be so serious, darling, it just what they want.",hap
" Oh you know all those superficial philosophers. We must laugh at them, be flippant.",xxx
 Flippancy brings out the acid in their darn sweetness and light.,hap
 Oh yes.  .,xxx
 We are figures of fun all right,hap
 Ahh...who knows.,hap
" No, that will fade...Along with our passion...",xxx
 Well it depends on how well we've played.,xxx
" Yes, yes with the all his might.",xxx
" No, no, no, no death is very laughable it's a cunning little mystery, you know.  It's all done with mirrors.",xxx
" Ah so is everyone in the long run, huh?",xxx
" Let's pity the poor philosophers, huh?  Let's enjoy the party for as long as we can, okay?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and sit like small idiotic school children. [LAUGHTER]",exc
" Come here darling, kiss me",exc
 before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets.,hap
" See, you know I don't care what you do.  You could paint yourself green and run naked to the Place Vendome.",hap
 You could run off with all the men in a world. I won't say a word.  Just as long as you love me best.,xxx
 Do you remember that row we did have in Venice?,hap
 The one when you put that little wooden painted snake in my bed?,xxx
 It was a horrible thing I hated it.,xxx
 Of course how long did that row last?,xxx
 But you know it wasn't as bad as the one we had in Cannes...mmhmm...where your curling irons burnt a hole in my dressing gown.,exc
 Oh that was a rouser wasn't it?,xxx
 I will never forget the look on his face.,hap
 oh...,hap
 We were very much younger then.,hap
" However, I do believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",xxx
" [LAUGHTER] Utterly, utterly ridiculous.",xxx
 Very much sillier.,xxx
 Oh you knew there was nothing in that.,xxx
 Presents? It was a trivial little broach.,sur
 Not at all. It was very pretty. I still wear it often.,xxx
 I did not you worked whole thing up in your jealous imagination.,xxx
" Well, what of it?",neu
" It gave him a lot, a great deal of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.",xxx
 If you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey you'd never known a thing about it.,xxx
 I'm bored with this conversation.,xxx
" No, thank you.",neu
 I don't see why you want any you already had two glasses.,ang
 I just think it's silly you know to go on and on and on about such a thing.,xxx
" I just, I just think it's becoming a habit with you.",xxx
 Do be quiet.,xxx
" Don't be stupid, what?",ang
" No, darling I'm just making myself fascinating for you.",xxx
 Well it's a woman's duty to allure the man. Watch me a minute will you?,ang
" Oh no, it isn't.",xxx
" Don't be stupid, shut up.",xxx
" Oh, well that's funny.  It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.",xxx
" Adders don't snap, they sting.",xxx
 They sting.,ang
" I don't care.  I don't care, do you understand?  I don't mind if they bark and they roll about like hoops.",ang
" Yes, I did quite a lot.",ang
" Oh, mind you own business.",ang
" You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you're drunk.",ang
 You always had a weak head.,ang
" On the contrary, a child two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",ang
 Shut up.,ang
 Not very funny darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy?,ang
 Why?,ang
 There are no people upstairs. It's a photographer's studio.,xxx
 They are away in Tunis.,ang
" Turn it on again, please.",ang
 Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.,ang
 I won't.,ang
 Stop it. No. Go away.,ang

 This is the end do you hear me?  Finally and forever.,ang
" Oh yes I am...Oh yes I am. Let go of me. You let go. You...urgh...You're a cruel friend. I loathe and I hate you. Marry you again...Ha...Never, never, never, never. I hope you die in torment. You beast.",ang
 [LAUGHTER],xxx
 We were very much younger then.,xxx
 Mmhmm.,xxx
" However, I do believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",xxx
 I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.,xxx
 It was bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.,xxx
 You sent out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,xxx
" Well, you let him kiss you.  You said you did.",xxx
 What of it?,xxx
 And what about me?,xxx
 That's a nice point of view I must say.,xxx
 So am I.  I'm bored stiff.  You want some brandy?,xxx
" I'll have a little, I think.",neu
" Oh, you know no particular reason besides they are very small glasses.",neu
 You can hardly call three glasses of liquor in a whole evening going on and on and on.,xxx
" Hmm.  Well, you needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any at the moment, okay?",xxx
" Really, Amanda.",fru
 Nothing.,fru
 Are you going out somewhere dear?,neu
 That reply has broken my heart.,xxx
 As matter the fact that's perfectly true.,xxx
" Yes, it is.",xxx
" You know, it's a pity you didn't have any more brandy. It would have made you just a little less disagreeable.",ang
" You know what?  You snap, you snap, you snap you're like a little adder.",ang
 Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind of fangs and they snap.,ang
 Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,ang
 I suppose you let him just kiss you or good deal more than too.,ang
" I suppose you two had a riotous time, huh?  No restrain at all, very enjoyable, he never had much any how.",ang
 I am not in the least bit drunk.,ang
 I think I told you once before that I had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A Child of two cannot get drunk on that.,ang
" Oh very, very interesting Amanda.  How about the child of uh... four, six or maybe nine---you know, we could work up a splendid little debate about it, you know?  Intemperate tots.",ang
 That's a very good idea I think I will.,ang
 Would you uh...turn that off please? You're going to wake the people upstairs.,ang
 Well then you'll wake the people downstairs.,ang
 This is no time a year for Tunis.,ang
 I will do no such thing.,ang
 Turn it off. It's driving me mad.,ang
 Turn it off.,ang
 Amanda listen. Listen.,ang
 That's very amusing indeed.,ang
" You...You're an evil minded, self-centered little wench and I never want to see you again.",ang
 You're not going like this.,ang
 No you're not.,ang
 Shut up. Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling back to me on a bended knee. You are an evil tempered little vampire and I never want to see you again as long as I live.,ang
" Hi. Excuse me.  Um, I'd like to put in this application for my registration.",neu
 My--my original birth certificate?  But I don't carry that with me.,sur
" Well, I have my driver's license, does that work?",xxx
 No it doesn't say it on the form.,fru
" I mean it just says that you need some form of identification, but it doesn't say what kind of identification.",fru
 I mean if I had known--I would have brought it.,fru
" Look, I've been waiting in line for a really long time.  I mean, you've seen how long it is.",fru
 It's lunch hour.,fru
" Well, no.  I mean, I don't carry my original documents with me because if those things get destroyed, then what do you, you know what I mean, like if I loose my wallet or something, I'll never have them again.",fru
 I have my passport and I have my driver's license. And that's all I have.,fru
" But, isn't there anything you can do.  Can't you make an exception this one time?  My picture is on both of those identifications.  It's not like you don't know that it's me.",fru
 And I can give you my social--,fru
" Well, I can give you my Social Security Number.",fru
 And I can tell you where I was born and what time and by who and what day.,fru
 I can't go--I have to go back to work.  I don't have time to go back to my house and get all of that stuff and then get back in line and wait for another forty five minutes.,fru
" Um, I have kids.  I have to take them places on the weekends.  I don't have time to come back here.  Please.  I really need you to help me.",fru
 Well.  [BREATHING] I just--I just don't.  I-I'm sorry that I'm standing here-- But I can't leave. I-,fru
" I really need this done today.  As you can see, the deadline is almost up and I can't come back.",fru
" Well, why didn't the D.M.V. put that you needed your birth certificate on the application then?",ang
" Yeah, but your birth certificate--I mean, who carries around their birth certificate?  Nobody does that.",ang
 With your driver's license and your passport.  Just like everybody else.,ang
" Who--you always use your driver's license.  I mean, you're not coming to the D.M.V. if you're not over sixteen and that's when you get your driver's license so you're never gonna need it anyway.",ang
 Do you have a supervisor?,fru
" Well, thank you very much.  You've been very helpful.",fru
 Hi.,neu
" Okay.  Let me see here.  Um, we need--we need your original birth certificate.",neu
 Right.  Well.  We still need it.,neu

 Right.  It's the D.M.V..,fru
" I know, it gets long, but I can't do anything without your--do you have Social Security card, maybe?",fru
" Alright, I don't know what to tell you right.",fru
" I think you're just gonna--you're gonna have to get 'em and then you can back and then, we'll help you out.  Maybe, we can-",fru
 I can't.,fru
" I make an exception for you and I have to make an exception for everyone.  I mean, I-I've seen this before and I know it's frustrating, but there's nothing I can do. You just have to-",fru
" No, it's--",fru
" Okay.  But how do I--that's- that's not proof to me.  How do I know that, you know, that it's really you.  I need--",fru
" Well, the weekends are not as busy.  Maybe you can uh, come and try to get here early--",fru
 I can't.  There's nothing I can do.  I'm sorry.,fru
 The line--,xxx
" Ok, but you're right now you're holding up more people in line by standing here-- and letting",ang
" I--when you're going to the D.M.V., you usually need pretty professional identification--",fru
" You know, Official documentation--",ang
" No, but you come--you come to the D.M.V., it's something-- You should've- You should've figured--",fru
" But, without your drive--where-where- what about your identification without your driver's license?  I mean, you need--you needed something before then?",fru
" All right.  Well, um, you know, I'd love to help you, but--nothing I can do.",fru
" So, if you wanna go get your birth certificate, um, maybe come back--I don't--maybe you can talk to the person in the--in the front of line maybe.  I don't know.",fru
 I am the supervisor.  So--,fru
 It's almost time for me to go.,sad

 I don't think so.,sad
" Well, we can do the best we can and-and, with um, you know like wireless internet these days--I think that we could-- Talk every once in awhile.",sad
 You could send me pictures.,sad
" Their not gonna let you.  You have to stay home and I have to go.  I mean, that's all--",sad
" and--I mean, my daughter--I don't want to put her in danger.  You know?  She has to stay.",sad
" I know, but, she needs to be safe more.  She needs to be around kids her age--own age.  She needs to be able to play on the streets and--",sad
 You can just remember it for me.,sad
" Well, I need--I need you to be able to do this for me 'cause I can't do anything about it.",sad
" I mean, it's just as hard for me, but--I know that we can do it, you know",sad
 I don't want you in danger.  And I don't want her in danger.,sad
 I have no choice. There's nothing I can do.,sad
 I can't believe that--now--are you sure this is absolutely necessary?  Like--,xxx
 What--what're we gonna do here?  I can't--I can't do this by myself.  I--,fru
" But, I'm--I'm nothing--I'm nothing without you here.  Maybe we can--we can get out of this somehow.",fru
" Well, come on.  You've gotta think of something.  A year--a year away, it's gonna tear us apart.  I don't even--I don't even wanna think about it.  I mean, I don't even know if I'll be able to get in touch with you or--",fru
 It's not going to be the same.,xxx
" What if--maybe--what if, uh, we went somewhere over there?  I don't--I don't know--I--I need to figure something out for this because--",fru
 This is gonna be a--a crucial yet--she's--she's growing up.  She's gonna need you.,fru
 But she's--you're not gonna--you're not gonna be here for--for her first words.  For her first steps.  I mean--it's something that you're supposed to be here for that--,sad
 I don't know--I don't know--I don't know how--I don't know how this could even be possible for you--I--if I was--,fru

 I just keep getting rejected.  I just keep getting rejected over and over and over again and it starts to make you feel like there must be something wrong with you that you can't get a job.,fru

 I feel so worthless.,sad
 And what would make you say that?  There doesn't seem to be any indicators that anything's going to get better.,fru

Like it's like suddenly it starts to feel like it's just you that they say no to and it's not that they're not taking applications and it's not that they're not hiring people, it's just you particularly they have some particular reason for just hating you.  You know?",fru
 Or they'll never talk to me again.,fru

 How do you lose a suitcase?  A huge suitcase?,sur
 How much?,neu

 I didn't sign anything.,fru

" I mean, is there somebody you can call?  Or the guy that put the stuff on the--on the plane.  I mean, are they--they must be really irresponsible to have just disappeared my baggage.  I mean, did it get stolen?",fru
" Yeah, I'm sure you -- You're like, hmm, do you take baggage?  No.  Oh, okay, thanks.  Great.  I mean how--",fru

" Uh, But, we are willing to reimburse you for the bag and and for the contents--",neu
" Um, we'd be willing to give you uh fifty dollars for--",neu
" Right.  Uh We realize, you know, that that it's a bad situation, but I'm sorry, there's nothing that we can really do.",neu
" I think, um, maybe you can file a claim if you want and turn it in to our main office--",neu
" Right.  No.  I mean they- they might--they might--if you-if you are argue the case more, maybe they'll reimburse you more, but, right now--",neu
" Yes, I know. I know-. It's It's frustrating.  Unfortunately though-- um",neu

" Right, well, by checking in your bags, you agreed to, you know, at the will of the--",neu
" You paid for the flight and then your bags were checked at--it's a service that the airline provides for us.  So so, really, it's really the risk was taken and, I'm sorry, but there's really nothing else we can do.  So do you want--do you want the reimbursement?",neu
" Well, there are-there are some shops here in- in the airport--",neu

" Right, that--that gets taken care of-- That gets taken care of.  We get we do, you know, we investigate those and just make sure that um- they're not doing their own thing with them so--uh",neu
 but Unfortunately sometimes is--,neu

" Okay.  Well that that could be something that you put on on the claim--on on the complaint form if you want.  And provide us with your information while you're here and then, maybe, if it turns up, then we'll send it right over.",neu
" All right, Miss, I-I know.  I realize this. But Like I said, there are several people that are in your same situation, so, um, it's not--it's not totally uncommon and I'm actually gonna have to ask you to move so I can help the next person.",neu
" Yes, all right.  There you go, now you can file a claim over to the left--And they'll help you out.",neu

 That's going to be a lot of work.,exc
" But, it'll be fine, I mean.  I'm so excited. It's going to be so fun.",exc

" Hi, my name is Shiloh, welcome to--Airline Six.  Hi, how may I help you?",neu
" All right, sir.",neu
 I completely understand.  Automated systems are very difficult sometimes.,neu
" Um, how may I help you.  You're trying to book a specific flight?",neu
" Oh, yeah, absolutely.  You know, and especially because you've been waiting so long and I know that, um, you've been having a difficult time.",neu
" I want to definitely give you our special package today, which um is usually only for valued customers who have a record of having previous,",neu
" um lots of purchases, but we're gonna go ahead and give that to you anyway. uh,  Just to make sure that you're happy with your service here.",neu
 Is that all right?,neu
" I can do that right now for you. No, absolutely.  I can take care of you all the way through to the end.",neu
 All I'm going to need is your credit card number but just give me one moment. So-,neu
" um, you're scheduling a flight as well--And you would like to, um, we have a highly discounted hotel rate that goes along with that so that everything is all in one deal.  You're taken care of by the time that you get there.",neu
 Absolutely. we we,neu
" Yes, I completely understand.  Actually, our-our airline only uses five star hotel and above.  Except we charge at a three star hotel rate because, as a corporation, we are able to get a deal from the hotels themselves.",neu
" So, you will absolutely be in a high rated great hotel and we can make sure that it's in a area of town that you like as well.",neu
 Yeah.,neu
 Okay.,neu
 Great.  How many seats?,neu
 Okay.  Great.  Four seats.  I'll book you for four seats.,neu
" Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Um- Would you like window seats or aisles?",neu
" Okay, I can do um- a win- -two like a window and a aisle and a window and an aisle next to each other so that each of you can sit two by two. And switch around maybe?",neu
 Okay.  Great.  What time of the day would you like?,neu
 All right.  Great.  Well we have a very open flight that leaves at nine a.m. and fortunately uh the time change actually goes um backwards from that.,neu
" So, it's a five hour flight, but you'll arrive only at eleven a clock in the morning.  So that day, you can have plenty of time to get to your hotel--Rest up and then still have a nice afternoon your first afternoon in Maui.",neu
 Absolutely.  That actually goes in on the same package with our hotel.  You just give me your address.  We'll come and pick up a time that allows you to get to your flight with plenty of time to spare.,neu
 And a there will also be a shuttle waiting for you to take you to the appropriate hotel.,neu
 Yeah--I completely understand.  It's a difficult process sometimes and we want to make traveling as easy as possible.,neu
 Absolutely. Thank you so much for calling and we hope that you will come to us again.,neu
 Thank you.,neu
" Yeah, hello.",fru
 Ok.  I've- I've just been talking to this machine for the past half hour and I can't-can't get anything done.  I've been trying to book this vacation this entire time.,fru
" I know, I'm sorry.  It's-It's just that it's been a little frustrating because--",fru
 Okay.,neu
" Well, yeah, I mean I heard there was like these package deals and that maybe I could get a like a hotel or something like that. and-",fru
 You- You can do that--You can do that now? I don't have to get like transferred through or anything like that.,neu
 [BREATHING] that's good.,neu
" All right.  I want to make sure it's like a nice hotel--I mean-mean I'm gonna be paying a lot of money for this so I don't wanna-I don't wanna, you know, I don't wanna to be a waste of time.",neu
 Okay. So--,neu
" Well, you know, we wanted to--we wanted to go to Maui and--That was a",neu
" --you know, the kids wanna go to the beach and stuff and so--um",neu
" Well, it's gonna be four of them.",neu
 All right.  And can they like all get together?,neu
" Um- You know, window is nice. I guess",neu
" All right, Sure.  A yeah, that- that'd be good.",xxx
" Uh, well, yeah, I think we were just--you know, whenever best available, I guess.  You know--",neu
" And, like, there's there's shuttles or something that I can get to the hotel.",neu
" Okay.  Wow.  Sounds good then, I guess.  Thank you very much. It's a lot better than talking to a machine.",xxx
 All right.  So we're confirmed then or do you--All right.,neu
 Okay.,neu
 What's he gonna say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.,xxx
" How could he see it?  I was the first one up, he was still in bed.",xxx
 When?,xxx
 What was he doing out here at four in the morning?,xxx
 Did you talk to him?,sad
 He cried hard?,sad
 What was he doing out here at that hour?,sad
 He's dreaming about him again.  He's walking around at night.,xxx
 He's getting just like after he died.  What is the meaning of that?,xxx
 What?,xxx
 What you mean dishonest?,xxx
 What do you want to do argue with him?,fru
 You can't say that to him.,fru
 Can you prove it?  How can you prove it?,fru
" To you it is and to me, but not to him.  I mean, you can talk yourself blue in the face, but he--there's no body and no grave so where are you?",fru
" Trouble is the God damn newspapers.  Every month or so a boy turns up out of nowhere so, you know, the next one is gonna be Larry.",xxx
 Why?,xxx
" I've got an idea, but what's the story?",sad
" Well, that's only your business, Chris.",neu
 What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.,ang
" Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't going to--",xxx
 I'm just saying that--,neu
 I ignore what I gotta ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.,xxx
" From your father's point of view, he isn't dead.  And you've no right to take his girl.",fru
" And you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.  Now what can I do for you?",fru
 You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that.,neu
 [BREATHING] Have you asked Annie yet?,neu
" Well, how do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way your father does.",neu
" Trouble is, you don't see enough women.",sad
 You never did.,fru
 I just don't see why it has to be Annie.,fru
" Well, that's a good answer, but it doesn't answer anything.  I mean, you've been away for--at war.  It's been five years.",fru
" I don't want a diagram.  Umm-- He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead.",fru
" I mean, what's gonna happen to your father?  Do you know?  I don't.",fru
 I just--give it some more thought.,fru
 What the hell is this?,sur
 Are you crazy?,ang
 What about the business?  What the hell is this?,ang
 Must you be inspired?,ang
" Tell me, you'd leave the business?",xxx
" Well, you don't want to think like that.",ang
" All right, but just don't go thinkin' like that 'cause otherwise what did we work for?  I mean, the whole thing is for you, Chris.  The whole shootin' match is for you.",xxx
" All right.  Just-- just don't go thinkin' that way, you hear me?",fru
" I don't understand you, do I?",fru
 I can see that.,sad
 He saw it.,xxx
 He was out here when it broke.,xxx
 About four this morning.  I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out. He was standing right here when it cracked.,xxx
" I don't know.  When it cracked, he ran back in the house and cried in the kitchen.",xxx
 No.  I thought it was best to leave him alone.,xxx
 I could hear him right through the floor of my room.,xxx
 I guess he is.,xxx
" I don't know the meaning of it.  But, I know one thing Mom, we made a terrible mistake with Dad.",xxx
" Being dishonest with him.  I mean, that sort of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.",xxx
 You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,xxx
" No, I don't want to argue with him, but it's about time he realized that nobody believes Larry's alive anymore?",xxx
 Why shouldn't he dream of him and walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had hope for years now?,ang
 We've got to say it to him.,fru
" For God sakes, it's been three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.",ang
" Sit down, Mom.  I want to talk to you.",xxx
 All right.  All right.  Listen to me.  You know why I brought Annie here don't you?,fru
 You know.,xxx
 I'm gonna ask her to marry me.,neu
 You know it's not only my business.,fru
 So it's all right then?,fru
 I'll go ahead with it?,fru
" Well, then it isn't just my business--",ang
" Ah, sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?  I mean, isn't it your business too if I tell Dad and flips--freaks out about it?  I mean, you have such a talent for ignoring things.",xxx
 She's not Larry's girl.,ang
" I don't know why, but, every time I reach out for something that I want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer.  My whole bloody life.  Time after time after time.",fru
 To hell with that.,ang
 I wanted to get this settled first.,xxx
" Well, if she does, then that's the end of it.  But from her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.  And then we'll thrash it out with Dad, right?  Mom, don't avoid me.",sad
" So what, I'm not fast with women.",xxx
 Because it is.,neu
" I can't help it.  I know her best.  I mean, I grew up next door to her.",xxx
" These years when I think of a wife, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?",fru
" All right.  All right, then, Mom.",fru
 I've given it three years of thought.  I thought that if I waited Dad would forget about Larry and we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.,fru
" But if I can't--if that can't happen here, then I'll have to get out.",xxx
 I'll get out.  I'll get married and go live some place else.  Maybe New York.,xxx
 I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.,ang
 The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,ang
" Yes.  I like it an hour a day.  If I'm gonna grub for my money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful.",ang
" I want a family.  I want kids.  I want something that I can give myself to.  Annie's in the middle of that.  Now, where do I find it?",xxx
" Yes, on this I would.",neu
 Then help me stay here.,xxx
" I know.  I know, Mom.  Just help me stay here.",fru
 I am thinkin' that way.,neu
" No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.",neu
 Why did he invite her here?,xxx
 She's been in New York for three and half years.  Why all of a sudden?,xxx
 Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,xxx
 She's not-,xxx
 -he's not gonna marry her.,oth
 It's got that all about it.,ang
" What's going on here, Joe?",xxx
" She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.",xxx
" Well then why is she still single?  I mean, New York is full of men.  Why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's crazy, but she's waited.",fru
" She knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.",fru
" Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe?  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",xxx
 I want you to act like he's coming back.  Both of you.  Don't you think I haven't noticed since she got here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.,fru
" Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  I mean, laugh--laugh at me, but...",ang
 But why did that happen the very night she came here?  She sleeps in his room and his memorial breaks to pieces.  Just look.  Look at it.,ang
" Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone.",fru
" Last week, a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  I mean, you read it yourself.",fru
" You, above all, have to believe.",fru
 Just--just don't stop believing.,fru
 I can't help it.,fru
 Why does that bother you?,xxx
" Well, maybe he just wanted to see her again.",neu
 What do you mean?  He lived next door to the girl all his life.  Why wouldn't he want to see her again?,neu
 Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anymore than he told you.,xxx
 How do you know he's even thinking of it?,neu
" Well, so what?",neu
" Now, listen Kate.",neu
 You can't read her mind.,neu
 How do you know why she's waited?,neu
" Look, it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for?",fru
" Well, what do you want me to do about it?",fru
 But Kate--,fru
 Calm yourself.,fru
 Calm yourself.,fru
 All right.  All right.  Calm yourself.,fru
 What?- Why- Why me above all?,xxx
 What does that mean?  Me above all?,ang
 Look at you.  Look at you shaking.,ang
 What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you Kate?,ang
 You're the only one I know who loves his parents.,xxx
 It's all right.  It's a good thing.,xxx
" You know, it's lovely here, the air is sweet.",xxx
" No, not sorry.  Um, but, I'm- I'm not gonna stay.",xxx
" Well, for one thing, your mother as much as told me to go.",xxx
" You saw that.  I mean and then, well, you've been kind of, um--",xxx
" Well, kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.",xxx
" I knew they would, your mother anyway.",xxx
" Well,",xxx
" from her point of view, why else would I come?",sad
 I--I guess this is why I came.,xxx
" Oh, Chris, I've been ready for a long, long time.",xxx
 I almost got married two years ago.,hap
 You started to write me and--,hap
 Every day since.,hap
" Well, I was waiting for you.  I mean, till then you never wrote and when you did, I mean, what did you say?  You can sure be ambiguous sometimes.",xxx
 I will never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I did was sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.,hap
 Not like that you're not.,xxx
" Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What is it?",xxx
" No.  What is it, your mother?",xxx
" Then, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed.",sad
 You've gotta tell me.,sad
 It wouldn't work this way.,sad
" Yeah, sure.",sad
 How many?,sad
" Oh, gee.",sad
 You still feel that way?,sad
" 'Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Because you have a right to everything that you have.  Do you understand that?  Everything, Chris, and me too.",xxx
" I mean, and your money, there's nothing wrong with your money.  I mean, your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  A man should be paid for that.",xxx
 What'll I do with a fortune?,hap
" I know, it went out of style, didn't it?",xxx
 You're not sorry you came?,neu
 Why?,xxx
 Oh.,xxx
 What?,xxx
" The trouble is, I planned on sort of sneaking up on you over a period of a week or so.  But, they take it for granted that we're all set.",xxx
" Oh.  Would you want to?  I guess you know, this is why I asked you to come.",xxx
" Anne, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you.",xxx
 I have no imagination.  That's all I know to tell you.,xxx
 I'm embarrassing you and I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted some place we'd never been before.  A place where we'd be brand new to each other.,xxx
" You feel it's wrong here, don't you?  This yard, this chair.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to have to win you away from anything.",exc
 And he's gone forever.  You're sure?,xxx
 Why didn't you?,xxx
 You felt something that far back?,xxx
" Anne, why didn't you let me know?",xxx
" Give me a kiss, Anne.  Give me a-",xxx
" oh God, I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.  How long--how long I've been waiting to kiss you.",xxx
" Oh, Annie, we're gonna live now.  I'm gonna make you so happy.",xxx
 I kissed you.,xxx
 Let's drive someplace.  I want to be alone with you.,xxx
 No.  Nothing like that.,sad
" Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.",sad
 I don't know how to start.,sad
" It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?",sad
" Well, I lost them.",sad
 Just about all.,sad
 It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.,sad
" For instance, one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.",sad
" They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.",sad
" I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that there was one new thing being made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man.",sad
" You know what I mean?  To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.",sad
 Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.,sad
" And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.",sad
" I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.",sad
 Because otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of it.  And I guess that included you.,sad
 I want you now Annie.,xxx
" I know Annie.  Annie, I'm gonna make a fortune for you.",xxx
 Fine.,xxx
 What flashlight?,neu
 That's not your flashlight.,xxx
 It's ours.  It's mine too.,xxx
" You kept saying my flashlight, if as if somehow it's just yours.  I mean is that supposed to make me feel?",xxx
 Yeah.,neu
 I'm cold.,xxx
" It's after eleven, let's just go home.",fru
 There is no point in coming down here.,xxx
 That's my point.,xxx
" So, let's go.",xxx
 Not particularly.,xxx
 I just don't.  It's stupid.,xxx
" Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, they flop around, and swim away.  And then they die.",fru
" What are you so excited about?  I mean, it's not a moon landing we're talking about here.  It's fish.  It's a fish nobody even eats.",fru
" Ah, Augie.",fru
 I'm just not.,fru
 Yeah.,xxx
" Last year, you will also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got in a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the grunions.",fru
 We didn't see them the first time either.,neu
 That's the wind.,xxx
 About what?,neu
 It's ridiculous.,xxx
 What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.,exc
" This is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here, couldn't be better.",exc
" I would have liked to have gone a little further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it.",exc
 How you doing?,exc
 Is that--no--is that just foam?  I can't even tell.,exc
" Well, I guess we can tell, it probably isn't right?  Probably be unmistakable don't you think?",exc
" How you doing?  Aw, you know what I forgot?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  Oh, how could I be so stupid?  I should've brought my flashlight.",exc
" You know, the flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one isn't there?",xxx
 Who's is it?,xxx
" Oh, well sure.",neu
" Right, of course.  Our flashlight.  Mine and yours.  I mean, me flashlight is su flashlight naturally.",neu
 How could we forget to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out.,xxx
" I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Do you remember?",neu
" You cold?  Do you want my jacket?  Oh, we should've brought the blanket.  Our blanket.",neu
" This is great, isn't it?  A six pack would be just the ticket right now.",exc
 I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.,exc
 You think they can hear us talk?  Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?,exc
 Do you want my jacket?,neu
 Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home.,xxx
 Right.,neu
 That's my point too.,neu
 No. No. That's not my point.  The point is there's no point in coming down if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?,neu
 Why not?,xxx
" Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  I mean this only happens once a year, you know.",xxx
" Think about the people in Kansas, they had to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to see this.  We live forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.",exc
" Yeah, but that moment on the beach, is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping is laying eggs or what do you--spawning or mating.  I mean,",exc
 this is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy.,exc
 Yeah they do.,fru
 Alright.  But it's fish that do something that none of the other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs.,exc
 There's--there's a bit of the magic--some unexplainable here.  I don't see how you can not be interested.,xxx
 For real?,xxx
" I don't get it.  The first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life.",neu
" And last year, I remember specifically you were so excited to go that you stubbed your toe rushing me out of the house and didn't even notice until we got in the car.",xxx
 We weren't in a good spot.,neu
" We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  Believe me, I've got good instincts for these things.",xxx
 There is that--no that's just seaweed isn't it?,exc
" Oh man, this is great, isn't it?  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  Here, think about this, all right, I know you're not interested, but think about this.",exc
" Somewhere out there, this huge mass of silver fish swimming this way.",xxx
" They don't know why, we don't know why.  Nobody sent them an invitation or a map, it wasn't a decision, just-",xxx
" all as one, this time release instinctual little firecracker went off and they all turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.  And they're swimming right now as if that's all that matters.",exc
 It's like single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge.  They don't know what drives them.  They don't ask it a question or give it a name.,exc
" They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them right here to where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.",exc
" Ah, God, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are popped up.",exc
" Well, so what do you think?",neu
 What I was saying.,neu
 About what?,neu
 It's ridiculous.,fru
 It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is gonna take place on the beach.,xxx
" Sure, everybody's told the same story.  It keeps us all excited.  It keeps us coming back for more.  It keeps us thinking that life is gonna start any second now if we could just find the right spot and get in on the action.",xxx
" Well, I'm sorry, but it's still just fish to me.",xxx
" God damn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting.",ang
 We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.,ang
" For heaven sake, we're not going to see the grunions.",fru
" We never do, do we?  I mean, have we ever?",fru
 Twice is every time we've tried. That's ever.,fru
" No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus.",fru
" I mean, I feel like my whole life is gonna be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up.  And the fish won't show up.",ang
 You don't understand anything I'm saying.,fru
 I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this is gonna be the time and it never is.,fru
" For heaven sake, this isn't about fish.",xxx
" Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago, right after we got married.",sad
" I thought I was pregnant, you had a bottle of champagne, but no glasses.  You asked me to dance, so we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork.",sad
" And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them.",sad
" And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, at last--at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be.",sad
" Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.",sad
 I'd rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.,sad
 No.,sad
 No.,sad
 No. No.,xxx
 No.,sad
 No.,fru
 No.,fru
 No.,fru
 I want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to.,xxx
 This.  What?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.,xxx
" Uh, right this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.",xxx
 Well.  This isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.,sad
" I mean, this is just this.  It includes a lot and everything, but it isn't something else.  Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?",xxx
" I know that, Augie.  Really, I do.",sad
" I know that you meant this to be special and nice and the sand and the moon and all, but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.",sad
 I didn't say that.,sad
" Oh, for heaven sake, whatever I'm doing, I'd rather be doing it with you.",xxx
" Oh, don't be ridiculous.  I mean, don't you know that?",xxx
 You're the one who probably wishes you were with someone else.  Someone who--you'd rather enjoy yourself and didn't take everything so hard.,sad
" Okay.  Fine so.  We're in the wrong spot, but we're with the right person.",xxx
" Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty, doesn't it?  Big ol' white moon.",xxx
" Augie, you brought refreshments.",hap
" Well, then we don't need glasses.",hap
 No.  I think you might be right.  Maybe this is the spot after all.,hap
" Augie, I'm sorry.",sad
 Or not.,hap
" Well, so what do you think?",exc
 What I was saying.,neu
 It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,neu
" Well, I'm not the only one.  Look at all these people.",neu
 Are we talking about the same thing?,xxx
" Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period?",neu
" Well, what's bugging you?",fru
" There's nothing to it.  We come here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home. We go home.",neu
 Why not?,fru
 We've missed them twice.  That's not ever.,neu
" Well, we'll see them this year.",neu
 I thought you wanted to see it.,fru
" No, of course not.",fru
 It's just fish.  Nothing to get traumatized about.,neu
" All right.  Look, I've been trying to work this backwards, but I cannot seem to figure out the exact moment that we took a turn for the worst.",fru
" I mean, you were-  you were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.  Let's see.  I took a shower.  You watched the news.",xxx
" You said, ""Hey the grunion are running tonight.""  I said, ""Great, let's go.  I feel lucky.""",neu
" Okay, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage--",neu
 Wait a minute.  I've got it.,neu
" It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, ""let's get some champagne,"" and I said, ""time's a wasting"" or something like that, right?",neu
" Yeah, of course, I see it now.  You want this to be like that other time, right?  That's it, right?",neu
" Okay, yeah, sure, I see it now.  Listen, you wanna dance?",neu
 You want me to go get some champagne?,neu
 Take off our shoes?,neu
" Well, what?  You want me to breathe in your ear?",fru
 You wanna get married again?,fru
 What?  What?  You want a divorce?,fru
 A vacation?,fru
" A new carpet?  A poodle?  Ice cream?  Back rub?  A suicide pact?  What?  What?  Carla, what the hell do you want?",fru
" Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed?  That four years down the road, we'd be at the beach yelling at each other over fish?",ang
" No.  You think I knew that there'd be times when you'd look at me like a used Kleenex?  Or that I'd look at you and think, holy hell, when's the next flight to Alaska?",xxx
" No, Carla, I'm just like you.  I thought it was gonna be all peaches and roses and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us",sad
" 'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.",fru
" Yes, it is.",neu
 Right.,neu
" I know, me neither.",sad
 I'm doing the best I can.,sad
 Maybe if you were with somebody else too.,sad
" No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy.",sad
 Yeah?,sur
" Well, now that you mention it.  No, I don't.",xxx
" I don't know.  It seemed like a pretty good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you have of the moon from here.",hap
" Well, look what we have here.",hap
 It's not champagne.,hap
 You still cold?  Do you wanna go home?,xxx
 Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come.,hap
 Or not.,hap
 Do you think it's them?,fea
" Well, nobody know we're here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.",fea
 What're we gonna do?,fea
" Now and always, sweet.",xxx
 It was bound to come sooner or later.,xxx
" Ah, it send shivers up my spine.",exc
 Behave exquisitely.,hap
" Oh, of course.  I shall probably do a court curtsy.",hap
 What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.,hap
 It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.,hap
" Yes, meaning just that.",hap
 Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.,xxx
 Who's they?,neu
" If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too.",neu
" Well how long will it last us, this ludicrous overbearing love of ours.",neu
" Well, shall we always want to bicker and fight?",neu
" Oh, dear, shall we like that?",neu
" Well, what happens if one of us dies?  I mean, does the one that's left still laugh?",neu
" That's serious enough, isn't it?",xxx
" Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.",hap
" Elliott, worms don't pop.",hap
" Oh, thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.",hap
 Which particular one?,hap
 Charles.  That was his name.  Charles.  He did wriggle so beautifully.,hap
" Yes, I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.",hap
 It went in intermittently for days.,hap
 It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.,hap
 That was the first time you ever hit me.,neu
" The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.",hap
 It was ridiculous.  Completely ridiculous.,exc
 And very much sillier.,xxx
 Good God.,xxx
 I wonder.,neu
" Must be them, then.",xxx
" We're all right, darling, aren't we?  Whatever happens.",xxx
 I don't care then.,neu
 Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number.,neu
 What do we do if they suddenly walk in on us?,xxx
 With the most perfect poise?,neu
 Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they?,neu
" Oh, darling, don't say that.",neu
" Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?",neu
" Oh, what does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?",xxx
" You mustn't be serious, my dear one.  That's just what they want.",neu
 All those futile moralists that try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.,neu
 Flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.,neu
" Certainly, you must.  We're figures of fun, alright.",neu
 Who knows.,neu
" No, that desire will fade.  Along with our passion.",neu
 Depends on how well we've played.,neu
 Yes.  Yes. With all his might.,exc
" No. No, it isn't.  Death is very laughable.  Such a cunning little mystery.  All done with mirrors.",exc
 So is everyone else in the long run.,neu
" Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can.  Like quite idiotic, very small school children.  Let's savor the delight of the moment.",exc
" Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.",exc
" I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint yourself green and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as you love me best.",neu
 You remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,neu
 The one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it on my bed.,neu
" Ah, horrible thing.  I hated it.",xxx
 How long did that row last?,neu
 The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.,neu
" That was a rouser, wasn't it?",xxx
 I didn't hit you very hard.,neu
" Oh, I'll never forget his face.",exc
 We were very much younger then.,neu
" As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",neu
" Honey, you knew there was nothing in that.",xxx
 Presents?  Just a trivial little broach.,xxx
" No, it wasn't.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often.",xxx
" No, I didn't.  You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.",xxx
" Just a little perhaps, nothing serious.",xxx
" Well, what of it?",xxx
 It didn't hurt him at all and I enjoyed it.,xxx
" Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.",neu
 I'm bored with this conversation.,xxx
" No, thanks.",xxx
 Don't see why you want any.  You've already had two glasses.,xxx
 Just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.,neu
" Well, it's become a habit with you.",neu
 Don't be so stupid.,ang
 What?,ang
" No, just making myself fascinating for you.",xxx
" A woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute, will you?",exc
" No, it isn't.",fru
" Oh, be quiet.",ang
 Doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.,fru
" Adders don't snap, they sting.",ang
 They sting.,xxx
" I don't care, do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't care if they bark or roll about like hoops.",fru
" Yes, I did.  Quite a lot.",xxx
 Mind your own business.,fru
 You're quite insufferable,ang
 I expect it's because you're drunk.,fru
 You've always had a weak head.,xxx
" On the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",fru
 Shut up.,ang
" Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.",fru
 Why?,ang
 There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.,fru
 They're away in Tunis.,xxx
" Turn it on again, please.",ang
" Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.",ang
 You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.,ang
 Stop it.  Go away.  I hate you.,ang
" Listen?  Listen, indeed.  I am sick and tired of listening to you, damn sadistic bully.",ang
" I hate you.  Stop it.  Stop it.  I hate you, do you hear?  You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.",ang
 This is the end.  Finally and forever.  Do you hear me?  The end.,ang
" Oh Yes, I am.",ang
 I am.  Let go of me.  You're a cruel fiend and I hate and loathe you.,ang
 Thank God I realized what you are-- I'd never marry you again ever in my life. You're a cruel fiend and I hate you. You're a beast. You're a beast--I hate you. Stop it.  Stop it.,ang
" As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",neu
 I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.,neu
" Ah, yes, I remember it well.  Bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.",xxx
 You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,xxx
" You must admit, he was in love with you, wasn't he?",xxx
 You let him kiss you.  You said you did.,xxx
 What of it?,ang
" Well, what about me?",ang
" Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.",xxx
" Me, too.  Bored stiff.  You want some brandy?",neu
 I think I'll have some.,xxx
 No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones.,neu
 You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.,fru
" You needn't be so grand, just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.",ang
" Really, Amanda.",xxx
 Nothing.,fru
 Going out somewhere dear?,xxx
 That reply has broken my heart.,xxx
" As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.",xxx
" Yes, it is.",fru
" Ah, it's a pity you didn't have any more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.",xxx
" Snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.",fru
 Nonsense.  They have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.,fru
 They snap.,fru
 Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,xxx
" Hmm, I imagine you let him kiss you a good deal more then.",xxx
" Oh, must have had a riotous time. No restraint at all.  Very enjoyable and never had much anyhow.",xxx
 I'm not in the least drunk.,ang
" As I mentioned before, I have had three minute liquor glasses of brandy the whole evening long.  A child of two couldn't get drunk on that.",fru
" Oh, very interesting.  How about a child of four?  A child of six?  Or a child of nine?",fru
" We could get a good debate going about this, don't you think?  Intemperate tots.",ang
 All right.  I will.,xxx
" You better turn that off, I think.",xxx
 Because it's late and it'll annoy the people upstairs.,fru
 There are people downstairs I suppose?,fru
 This is no time of the year for Tunis.,fru
 I'll do no such thing.,ang
 Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.,ang
 Turn it off.,ang
" Amanda, listen. listen",ang
" Very amusing, indeed.",fru
" You're a vile, tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I hope to never see you again as long as I live.",ang
 You're not going like this.,ang
 You're not.,ang
 Shut up. Shut up.,ang
 I wouldn't-- I wouldn't marry--,ang
 I wouldn't marry you if you came in crawling on your knees,ang
 You're a evil vampire and I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live.,ang
" Hi, How can I help you?",neu
" Sure, um",neu
 do you have two forms of ID with you?,neu
" I actually need two forms of ID. I need either a passport or a birth certificate, or social security card. I'm sorry.",neu
 Well,neu
 I- I can take your driver's license but I need another form of ID in order to process this paper work.,neu
" Um, that you would need to go home and get another form of ID and come back.",neu
" Well, I'm sorry sir but",fru
 you need to bring two forms of ID there is nothing we can do about it.,fru
" Well, it's actually-",fru
" It's standard that you bring a couple of forms of ID, I'm sorry.",fru
" Well, I'm sorry, sir, but we're not responsible.",fru
" Yes, you did, thank you very much, but we're not responsible if you've forgotten something, and we need to have two forms of ID.",fru
" I'm sorry, but there is a lot of people waiting so you're just going to have to get in line again.",fru
" It just happens to people all the time, I'm sorry sir, but I can't make an exception for you.",fru
" I'm sorry, sir.",neu
 there is nothing I can do.,neu
" I know sir, but we have to have two forms. There is nothing I can do about it, I'm sorry.",fru
" I'm sorry, sir. There is nothing I can do.",fru
" Well, if you had checked the web site it would have said.",fru
 If you had checked the website it would have said that you needed two forms of identification.,fru
" Well, maybe you should",fru
 Right. So maybe you should go home now and get your paperwork and come back.,fru
" I'm sorry sir but there's a lot of people waiting. So if you won't move out of the way, then I'm going to have to call security.",fru
" I'm sorry, sir, it's not my choice.",fru
 All right. Finally. Here you go.,fru
" Yea. I just want to get this done,",neu
 get my new license.,neu
" Um, no, I got my driver's license though.",neu
" Uh, sorry, I forgot them. I mean I've got to -",neu
 well is the dri-driver's license going to work?,neu
" Okay, so what are you saying? What-",fru
" What? I- You telling me I waited in that huge line to go and sit down and get my number called, like after",ang
 three hours and,ang
 Shouldn't they have like told us about that? I mean why - why would they make me go and wait three hours if I have got to go and do it again?,ang
" It's standard? I mean I don't work at the D.M.V. how am I supposed to know that, like, I stand in line, I get my",ang
" I filled out the application right, didn't I?",ang
 Okay. What about - no -- how about you hold that and I'll - I'll go and I can come back-,fru
 I've been waiting for three hours.,fru
 This is ridiculous. Come on,fru
" I cannot go back in that line. I've got stuff I need to do, I mean-",fru
" But my driver's license - I had to have my birth certificate to get my driver's license in the first place right, I mean this - here is my driver's license so",xxx
 That doesn't make any sense. Why?,fru

 I would have thought you would have told me that you were planning on doing this.,exc

 Yeah.,xxx
 So what did you do?,xxx
" Oh, You did not.",exc
" Oh, my Gosh. that's so cute",exc

 She must have flipped out.,exc
 Right exactly because you can't say no in front of thousands of people. [LAUGHTER],exc
 Did you bring her up on stage too?,exc
" Oh, my Gosh, that's so cute.",exc
 Are your parents excited or...?,exc

 I know Uhm- I can't believe it.  It's like-,xxx
" Well, yes, I wanted it you know I guess sort of as a surprise for everyone so",xxx
" Yes, yes. You know, she - she was like - I mean, she was happy, you know",exc
" I - I think it was about time, I don't know, maybe. You know what, it's been it's been long enough now.",exc
" Oh, well, it was -- you know, we were at this- at this concert and yeah",hap
 so I-I talked to some of the crew before hand and-,hap
 I-I did.,hap
" So I got the band to do something, you know, like towards the end of the song I got to go up on stage and, uh",xxx
" I know, so",hap
 I got to freak her out.,hap
" No, yes -- so",exc
" Yea, that way she was guaranteed that she could not say no.",hap
" No, but it was good.",exc
" Yes, yes. [LAUGHTER]",exc
" I know it was, I don't know I was really nervous but I'm really - I'm really glad.",exc
" Oh yes, they - they you know they love her and so I mean...",hap
" Well, we're thinking uh - we're thinking winter time, you know, we're going to do it in the winter and then maybe, you know, maybe",xxx
" I don't know either do a honeymoon like in the snow or fly down to like Australia, Southern Hemisphere, [GARBAGE] so we'll decide with that.",xxx
" Yea, yea, I'm not too sure where yet I guess you know, I kind of got to figure some stuff out here first",exc
 but like you know it's just - I guess we're just excited right now that we'll get to continue it together.,xxx
 I know.,exc
" Oh, it will, obviously you know. But I know it's something - I don't know, you never really think about it happening, like before hand.",hap
" Sure. Oh, yes.",hap
 You know I had my mom come along maybe help me out a little bit because she's got good taste. but,xxx
" Yes, well, Thanks, thanks. Thank you. yeah",exc
 Hah.,hap
 So how you feeling?,neu
" You've been doing a lot of work for it, right?",neu
" Right, so the fact you doing the best that you can is -",neu
" you know you shouldn't give yourself a hard time for that, it's the best you can.",neu
" Well, but you care about what you do, right?",neu
" I understand that it's so frustrating but I know that you're here because you really want it you know and, and uh",neu
" Well, I mean you're still here you've tried for this long so I think that says something all in itself.",neu
 You are persistence. I mean that's important. that's,neu
" Well, you're talented so keep that in mind, you know, you shouldn't give yourself too hard of a time.",neu
 I'm sorry.,sad
" That's- I mean. There are more factors then just whether you're good or not, you know what I mean like",neu
" and the fact that you know there is always different types of things and what kind of people they want in the office and whether it's male or female or you know what I mean, like things are out of your control.",neu
 So you should take that in consideration rather than giving yourself such a hard time.,neu
" It might be the latter I don't know because you're not the worst, I mean you're great, you very talented at what you do.",xxx
" You know and the fact you still here and still cooking, like it's good that you're thinking about it, that you're reconsidering.",neu
" But like, just because you're considering why it's been so difficult doesn't mean you should just stop.",neu
" Maybe you should take a little break from it, but I don't think you should stop.",neu
" Get out of town or something, I mean you need - you need to clear your head 'cause you seem like you're really frustrated about it. I mean you need to like, be excited about you're doing, rather than, you know upset.",xxx
" Uhm, I don't know",fru
 I don't know what I'm going to do about this; I mean,fru
" I have got to get a job, you know? Like-",fru
" Well, yea you know, I get my resumes and I mean I-",fru
" I go out all the places I can, every place that'll give an interview you know.",fru
" But it's been so long, like what - what am I - what am I waiting -- I should probably just do something else, or",fru
" I don't know, I mean why - why",fru
" Yea, but it's - it's almost like it's not worth it you know, if I'm going to waste to have my life like trying to get a job, I mean once I actually do get the job it's like oh, retirement or something. I don't know, you know.",fru
" Well, and that's what I begin to question after a while is maybe I just don't want it, maybe it's not even worth it, you know, like",xxx
" I don't even know if it's going to be worth it because I can't break myself in, you know like I can't - can't even get a foot in the door you know.",fru
" Yea, it says I'm stupid enough to be trying this long and not move on somewhere else.",fru
" I mean, I can't- I can't be persistent forever, you know, you can't not have a job forever, you know, I've got- I've got to do something, I've got to make money and get food on the table.",fru
" I mean, maybe I'm not, you know. I don't have a job. Maybe - maybe I'm not as good as-as I thought I was and",fru
 I just got a whole skewed opinion on just how this is supposed to work out and,fru
" I don't know, it's just not, I don't know - I don't know what to do really, you know, I'm just thinking",sad
" maybe - maybe take up painting, I don't know, you know.",fru
" Do something that I don't have to go out and do something, stay at home, I don't know.",fru
 Seems like the only option at this point because obviously the outer world has just rejected me of all possible employment.,fru
" I know, but I mean- if that's the - you know, I'm either like the worst at this or just the most unlucky person on the planet I mean this doesn't",fru
 this doesn't happen to a normal person.,ang
" I mean, I don't know, I don't see - I don't see any other way - any other way around it right now.",fru
 What am I going to do on a break?,xxx
 Right. Thanks for talking to me.,sad
" Hi, can I help you?",neu
" Oh, did you check? Did you make sure as it went around the second time that it-",neu
" Okay. Well, um- the f.",neu
" Actually I'm looking here at the information, the flight that you were on we had some trouble with some of the baggage, it looks like a few peoples' bags didn't make it through. Um, so-",neu
" Well, you can fill out this paperwork um- and if for some reason it shows up, we can bring it to you, but-",neu
" Well, sometimes it's just late baggage or misplaced baggage and it comes out but it seems to be here and just I'm reading off of this that",neu
 Uh- it didn't make it into the second plane so it looks like there - they don't actually know what happened to it.,neu
" Um, well, sometimes there is just difficulties with loading on to the plane. Uh- There can be a theft or uh- some sort of you know mishap with a cart or something.",neu
" I- I- I understand, but um.",neu
 Okay,neu
 Right.,neu
" I understand that. Um- So I'm going to put down here that you looking for your baggage, but we actually can't, uh this bag is likely not going to show up so what we're going to do-",neu
" Sometimes it gets stolen, sometimes it gets misplaced on another plane and",neu
" they - they, it gets shipped to somewhere else and then it's stuck somewhere and then we have no way of tracking that.",neu
 So we'll- what we'll do,neu
 Right. Like I said sometimes a theft and things happen like that but we are willing to reim-reimburse you.,neu
" Um, so.",neu
" We have very tight security but we -uh- there are times when we just can't uh make sure there aren't absolutely no human error, you know",neu
 I'm sorry there is no guarantee on baggage.,neu
" I understand, so-",neu
" all right, We've already checked back here for your baggage",neu
 and we will continue to look for it and because your paper-,neu
" I've already looked, thank you very much and because we've filled out paperwork if it shows up we will send it to you but otherwise what we can do is reimburse you for fifty dollar.",fru
" Well, it's- it's just sort of help with the fact uh that you lost some of your possessions and we rather do that than-",neu
 The airline can't afford to give you everything that is in that suitcase. and so-,neu
 Well because lots of people get their baggage lost and we don't want to have false claims or anything like that so we have,neu
" we can give you fifty dollar to sort of make up for it, to compensate, and we can definitely let you know if it shows up but likely, more than likely-",neu
 I'm sorry. I don't- I-,xxx
 I don't believe you should sue the airline company but we do have a policy uh- in which we can reimburse you and that's all we can do and I'm sorry I've done everything I can-,fru
 There's other people waiting-,fru
 Fine.,xxx
 Hi. Um-,neu
 It seems that uh- my-my bag didn't make it out on the carousel.,neu
" Yes, yes, it's gone around like you know twenty times. It's been about a half hour.",neu
 Okay. So what-what do I have to get you know,neu
" For some reason, so you think it won't show up?",sur
 What? What? How does that happen?,xxx
 I really - I really need that bag.,fru
 there are- I have important things in that bag. I've got,xxx
" I mean -- I've been away for a while and- and now I've- I've gifts for- for you know friends and family I mean, I got stuff in the there",fru
 It's worth a lot.,xxx
" Not going to show - well isn't like - wouldn't it just be at the airport, that, like, if it didn't get on the other plane",fru
 can they check there?,fru
 on another-,xxx
" But we have the tags on. I mean like it wouldn't you know, if it got stuck somewhere it's like well this is nobodies bag I mean maybe you know look on the tag and",ang
 see where it came from originally. I mean it seems like-,fru
 Theft?,xxx
" Theft? Don't you know like all these people that are work - you keep like an eye on them, how can they get away with-",ang
 This is unbelievable. I've got,fru
 you don't realize the stuff that I've got in that - I really need to get the suitcase okay,ang
" so if it's back there or something, if there is something you can do",fru
" I need you to tell me because I really need to get the bag, okay?",fru
 You've already checked? Can you check again? [garbage],fru
 Fifty- fifty dollars? Come on you have got to be joking.,xxx
" Uh huh, yea, lost some of my possessions, yes, so if I lost maybe a shoe that was in the suitcase and like a carry-on",fru
" that might be like fifty dollars okay, but this - I- [garbage] I had like thousands of dollars worth of stuff in that suitcase.",fru
 The a- what? Talking about a core they can't afford it? I mean-,ang
 I mean you're not helping me here. What do I have to do here? Do I need to sue the airline company is that what I should do,ang
 because this is ridiculous?,fru
 All right. I'm sick- I'm sick of this all right. I'm sick of you and keep your fifty dollar.,fru
 What's going on?,xxx
" Oh my God. Oh my God, I'm so sorry.",sur
" It doesn't make any easier, yes.",sad
" Oh, man. I'm so sorry.",sad
" It's going to be so rough, I'm sorry.",sad

" I mean at least she was home, she wasn't in the hospital anymore,",sad
" She was with- yeah  She was with Gary, and he said that she was just sitting there and went to sleep, closed her eyes, and that was it.",sad
" Yes. I mean, it's not as rough on me as it is on him but",sad
" God, it's you know, we've spent so much time with them it's just really surreal, really weird that we're not going to be able to see her anymore and go",sad
" out to- out to dinner you know and do the troops to California, I mean.",sad
" It's just that- I don't know, it's sort it's sort- of a weird thing you know",sad
" not being able to see anyone again, who knows where they really went, you know. I mean, I guess we can just hope that wherever they are now if it's anywhere that it's better I mean.",sad
 She was [garbage],sad
" Yes, I mean she cared about all of us. She was great",sad
 so loving everybody you know.,sad
" Gosh, I just hate I just hate to see her go.",sad
 We were all going take a trip to Europe you know.,sad
 Yes.  [BREATHING] God.,sad
" I just -- I just don't get it, like there is just nothing you can do about it you know, it's like just out of your control and it",sad
" just makes it that much harder to deal 'cause as much as you want to, you know, make her better, see her not in any pain, it's like, just I don't know, just has a mind of its own.",sad
 Then she's gone.,sad
" Well, you know I appreciate you coming over and talking to me, I mean it definitely helps",sad

 it's a different number and everything,neu
 Yeah. yeah.,neu
" Yes, um but  for- for that- for that charge we will need you to send something in but we can get you processed immediately for this, for this, for this new card. It still goes to the same address, right?",neu
 Okay. All right. Then we'll get it sent out there. And,neu
 And you know just I mean be careful in the future if um,neu
 if you're ever online or anything like that I mean just make sure it's a secure site and,neu
" and never you know, give it to anyone out, never even give out your number to any like unreliable company that you haven't heard of or anything like that, all right? Because, um, we want to- we definitely want to help you out, but-",neu
 you know it gets- it gets difficult you know so Alright.,neu
" Alright Yes, I'm sorry for all the inconvenience but we'll get it taken care of.",neu
" What's he going to say, maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.",xxx
 How could he see it? I was the first one up he was still in bed.,xxx
 When?,xxx
 What was he doing out here at four in the morning?,xxx
 So you talked to him?,xxx
 He cried hard?,xxx
" What was he doing out here at that hour? He's dreaming about him again, he's walking around at night.",xxx
 He's getting just like after he died. What is the meaning of that?,xxx
 What?,xxx
 What do you mean dishonest?,xxx
" What do you want to do, argue with him?",fru
 You can't say that to him.,fru
" Can you prove it, how can you prove it?",fru
 To you it is and to me. You can talk yourself blue in the face but there is no body and no grave so where are you?,fru
" The trouble is the god damned newspapers, every month or so a boy turns up out of nowhere, so the next one is going to be Larry.",xxx
 I got an idea but what's the story?,neu
" Well that's only your business, Chris.",xxx
 What do you want me to do; you're old enough to know your own mind.,fru
" Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't-",neu
 I'm just saying,fru
 I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl.,xxx
 From father's point of you he isn't dead and you have no right to take his girl.,neu
" You can go on from there if you know where to go but I don't know where to go, see I don't know. So what can I do for you?",fru
 You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that.,neu
 Have you asked Annie yet?,fru
 How do you know she'll marry you? Maybe she feels the same way your father does.,neu
" Trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did.",ang
 I just don't see why it has to be Annie.,ang
 That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything. I mean you haven't seen her since you went away to war it's five years.,fru
" I don't want a diagram. He thinks he's coming back. Chris, you marry this girl you're pronouncing him dead.",fru
" Do you know what's going to happen to your father because I don't, see?",fru
 Just give it some more thought.,xxx
 What the hell is this?,ang
" What the hell is this, are you crazy?",ang
 What about the business? What is this?,ang
 Must you be inspired?,ang
" Tell me, you'd leave the business?",ang
" Well, you don't want to think like that.",ang
" All right. But you don't want to be thinking like that 'cause otherwise what did we work for, I mean the whole thing is for you, Chris, the whole shooting match is for you.",xxx
 Just don't go thinking that way.,fru
" I don't understand you, do I?",fru
" Yea, I can see that.",sad
 He saw it.,xxx
 He was out here when it broke.,xxx
 About four this morning. I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out. He was standing right here when it cracked.,xxx
 I don't know. When it cracked he ran into the house and cried in the kitchen.,sad
 No. I figured it was best to leave him alone.,sad
 I could hear him right through the floor in my room.,sad
 I guess he is.,xxx
" I don't know the meaning of it, but I know one thing mom, we've made a terrible mistake with dad.",xxx
 Being dishonest with him. I mean that sort of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.,xxx
 You know that Larry is not coming back and I know it. Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,fru
" No I don't want to argue with him, but it's about time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive anymore.",fru
" Why -- why shouldn't he dream of him? Walk around, waiting for him at night I mean do we contradict him, do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore that we haven't had hope for years now?",fru
 We've got to say it to him.,ang
" For God sakes it's been three years, nobody comes back after three years, that's insane.",ang
 Sit down mom; I want to talk to you.,xxx
 All right. All right. Listen to me.,fru
 You know why I brought Annie here don't you?,neu
 You know.,neu
 I'm going to ask her to marry me.,neu
 No it's not only my business.,fru
 So it's all right then I'll go ahead with it?,fru
 See it isn't just my business-,ang
 Sometimes you infuriate me you know that. Isn't it your business to if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it? You have such a talent for ignoring things.,xxx
 She's not Larry's girl.,fru
" I don't know why but every time I reach out for something that I really want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time after time.",ang
 To hell with that.,ang
 I wanted to get this settled first.,neu
" Well, if she does then that's the end of it. From her letters I think she's forgotten him.",neu
" I don't know, I'll find out. Then we'll trash it out with dad, right? Mom, don't avoid me.",sad
 So what I'm not fast with women.,fru
 Because it is.,fru
" I can't help it I know her best. I mean lived next door to her my whole life. These years when I think of a wife, I think of Annie.",fru
" What do you want, a diagram?",xxx
 All right. All right. Mom.,xxx
" I've given it three years of thought. I thought that if I waited, dad would forget about Larry and we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.",xxx
" If I can't do that here well, then I'll have to get out.",sad
" I'll get out. I'll get married and go live some place else, maybe New York.",sad
" I've been a good son too long a good sucker, I'm through with it.",ang
 The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,ang
" Yes, I like it and hour a day. If I'm going to grub for money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful.",ang
 I want a family; I want kids; I want something I can give myself to. Annie is in the middle of that. Now where do I find it?,xxx
" Yes, on this I would.",sad
 Then help me stay here.,fru
 I know I know mom. All right. Just help me stay here.,fru
" Well, I am thinking that way.",fru
" No, you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy.",xxx
 Why did he invite her here?,ang
 She's been in New York three and half years why all of a sudden-,ang
 Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,ang
 He's not going to marry her.,ang
 It's got that all about it.,xxx
 What's going on here Joe?,ang
 -She's not his girl Joe; she knows she's not.,ang
" Then why is she still single, I mean New York is full of men, why isn't she married? Probably a hundred people told her she's crazy but she's waited.",fru
" She knows what I know, that's why. She's faithful as a rock. In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.",fru
" Nobody in this house dares take her faith away Joe. Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",fru
" I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you. Don't you think I haven't noticed since he invited her, I won't stand for any nonsense",ang
" Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself. And laugh -- laugh at me but",fru
" why did that happen the very night she came back she sleeps in his room and suddenly his memorial breaks to pieces, just look at it, look.",xxx
 I need you to believe with me; I can't stand all alone.,sad
" Even last week there was a man who showed up in Detroit missing longer than Larry, you read it yourself.",fru
 Just you above all need to believe.,fru
 Don't stop believing.,fru
 I can't help it.,fru
 Why does that bother you?,xxx
" Well, maybe he just wanted to see her again.",neu
" What do you mean? He lived next door to the girl all his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again?",fru
" Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told you.",fru
 How do you know he's even thinking of it?,neu
" Well, so what?",neu
" All right. Now, listen kid-",xxx
 You can't read her mind.,neu
 How do you know why she has waited?,fru
" Look it's a nice day, what are we arguing for?",fru
 What do you want me to do about it?,fru
 But Kate,fru
 Calm yourself.,fru
 Calm yourself.,fru
 All right. All right. Calm yourself.,fru
" Wait, why my above all?",xxx
" What does that mean, me above all?",ang
 Look at you -- look at you shaking.,ang
" What have I got to hide? What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?",fru
 You're the only one I know who loves his parents.,xxx
 It's all right.  It's a good thing.,hap
" You know, it's lovely here, the air is sweet.",hap
" No, not sorry.  But, um. But I'm not gonna stay.",hap
" For one thing, your mother as much as told me to go.",xxx
" You saw that.  I mean and then, well, you've been kind of, um--",xxx
" Well, kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.",xxx
" I knew they would, your mother anyway.",hap
" Well, from her point of view, why else would I come?",neu
 I guess this is why I came.,hap
" Oh, Chris, I've been ready for a long, long time.",xxx
 I almost got married two years ago.,xxx
" Well, you started to write me",hap
 Every day since.,hap
" Well, I was waiting for you.  I mean, till then you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  I mean, you can sure be ambiguous sometimes, you know?",xxx
" I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  I mean, all I did was sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.",xxx
 Not like that you're not.,xxx
" Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What is it?",xxx
" No.  What is it, Chris. Your mother?",xxx
" Well, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed.",sad
 You've gotta tell me.,xxx
 It wouldn't work this way.,sad
" Yeah, sure.",xxx
 How many?,xxx
 gee.,xxx
 Do you still feel that way?,sad
" 'Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Because you have a right to everything you have, Chris.  Everything, you understand that?  Me too.",sad
" I mean, and your money, there's- there's nothing wrong with your money.  I mean, your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  A man should be paid for that.",sad
 What'll I do with a fortune?,hap
" I know, it went out of style, didn't it?",hap
 You're not sorry you came?,xxx
 Why?,xxx
 Oh.,xxx
 What?,sur
" The trouble is, I planned on sort of sneaking up on you on a period of a week or so.  But they take it for granted that we're all set.",fru
 How'd you know?,xxx
" Oh.  Would you want to?  I guess you know, this is why I asked you to come.",xxx
" Ann, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you.",xxx
 I have no imagination.  That's all I know to tell you.,xxx
 I'm embarrassing you and I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted some place we'd never been before.  A place where we'd be brand new to each other.,exc
" You feel wrong here, don't you?  This yard, this chair.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to have to win you away from anything.",xxx
 And he's gone forever.  You're sure?,xxx
 Why didn't you?,sur
 You felt something that far back?,exc
" Ann, why didn't you let me know?",exc
" Give me a kiss, Anne.  Give me a-",xxx
" God, I kissed Annie.  How long--how long I've been waiting to kiss you.",xxx
" Oh, Annie, we're gonna live now.  I'm gonna make you so happy.",xxx
 I kissed you.,xxx
 Let's drive someplace.  I want to be alone with you.,sad
 No.  Nothing like that.,sad
" Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.",sad
 I don't know how to start.,xxx
" It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in charge of a company?",xxx
" Well, I lost them.",sad
 Just about all.,sad
 It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.,sad
" For instance, this one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but those are the kind of guys I had.",sad
" They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  I mean, a little more selfish and they'd have been here today.",sad
" I got this idea watching 'em go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that one new thing was made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man. You know what I mean?",sad
" To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone can feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.",sad
" Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here. I mean, the whole thing to them seemed like it's sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.",sad
" And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.",sad
" I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta realize that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.",sad
 Otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of that.  And I guess that included you.,sad
 I want you now Annie.,neu
 I know Annie.  I'm gonna make a fortune for you.,xxx
 Fine.,neu
 What flashlight?,neu
 That's not your flashlight.,fru
 It's ours; it's mine too.,fru
 But you kept saying my flashlight as if somehow it's just yours. I mean how is it supposed to make me feel?,fru
 Yea.,neu
 I'm cold.,neu
 It's after eleven. Let's just go home.,fru
 There is no point in coming down here.,fru
 That's my point.,fru
 So let's go.,fru
 Not particularly.,neu
" I don't, it's just stupid.",fru
" Pass up what? These little fish swim onto the beach flop around and swim away, and then they die.",fru
 What are you so excited about? I mean it's not a moon landing we're talking about here it's fish. It's a fish nobody even eats.,fru
 Augie,fru
 I'm just not.,sad
 Yes.,neu
" Last year you'll also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the Grunions.",ang
 We didn't see them the first time either.,fru
 That's the wind.,neu
 About what?,neu
 It's ridiculous.,fru
 What time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight.,exc
" God, this great, isn't it? Like look at the night we go here, it couldn't be better.",exc
" I would have wanted to go a little further up the coast, get away from the lights and the people but I was afraid we'd miss it.",xxx
 How you doing?,exc
" Is that -- is that, no? Was that just foam? I can't even tell.",exc
" Although, I guess you can't tell it probably isn't them. Probably be unmistakable don't you think?",exc
 How you doing? You know what I forgot? I forgot to bring my flashlight. How - how could I forget to bring my flashlight? How could I be so stupid?,exc
" You know the flashlight, the silver one, there is only one, isn't there?",fru
 Who's is it?,fru
" Oh well, sure, yes.",xxx
" No. No. Of course our flashlight yours and mine. Mi flashlight, es su flashlight, naturally.",xxx
 How could we forget to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out.,xxx
" I wonder do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year, do you remember?",xxx
" You cold, you want my jacket? We should've - we should've brought our blanket, our blanket, how could we forget to bring the blanket?",exc
" Oh, a six-pack, that's, should've brought a -- a six-pack be just the ticket right now. How could I forget,",exc
" oh man. Like a kid, it's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.",exc
 You think they can hear us talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?,exc
 What you want my jacket?,xxx
" Are you kidding, we'd miss it. We, we just got here. What's the point in coming down here if we just turn around and go home?",fru
 Right.,xxx
 That's my point too.,xxx
 No. No. That's not my point. The point is there is no point in coming down here if we just leave. Don't you want to see it?,xxx
 Why not?,sur
" Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean it only happens once a year.",exc
" Think about the people in Kansas, they- they'd have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservations to see this. We live forty minutes away it's too good to pass up.",exc
" Yea, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. I mean all that flopping is laying eggs or what do you, mating or spotting or something like that.",exc
" This is a big night for these guys, life's last orgy.",exc
 Yes they do.,fru
" Okay. But it's fish that do something none of the other fish do. Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the Lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs",exc
" you know there is like, there is a certain mystery here, a magic, a bit of the unexplainable. I don't see how you cannot be interested.",exc
 For real?,sur
 I don't get it. The first time we came here you said it was the best night of your life.,xxx
" And then last year I remember specifically you were so excited that you stubbed your toe on the way pushing me out of the house, and you didn't even notice until we got in the car.",fru
 We weren't in a good spot.,xxx
 We just weren't in a good spot; this is a much better spot. I've got good instincts for these things.,fru
" There is that, oh no that's just seaweed, isn't it?",exc
" This is, this is great, isn't it? I wouldn't miss this for anything. Now listen to this, I know you're not interested but just listen.",exc
" Out there somewhere there is this huge mass of silver fish headed this way,",exc
" they don't why, we don't know why. They didn't take a vote or anything; they didn't get a map or an invitation.",exc
" Just all as one. This little time sensitive firecracker, instinctual firecracker in their body just went off and all as one they turned and formed a line as long the California coast and started swimming. They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.",exc
" It's single mindedness, with no mind, it's urgency that's pure urge, they don't know what drives them. They don't ask it a name or ask it a question,",exc
" they just turn as one and start the swim and brings them right here to this spot where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.",exc
 Look at me; I'm giving myself goose bumps all my hairs are popping up.,exc
" Well, so what do you think?",xxx
 What I was saying.,xxx
 About what?,xxx
 It's ridiculous.,fru
 It's PR. Someone sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach.,xxx
" Yea, sure everyone was sold the same story. I mean it keeps us all excited, keeps us coming back for more, keeps us thinking that life is going to start any second now if we can just get in on the action and find the right spot.",xxx
 I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me.,xxx
 Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that. I hate it when you ask me that. You always ask me that. It's insulting.,ang
 We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.,ang
 For heavens sake we are not going to see the Grunions.,fru
" We never do, do we? I mean have we ever?",fru
" Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever.",fru
" No we won't; it's pointless. It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus,",fru
 I mean I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on the beach waiting for the fish to show up with my eyes open and my hands clasped expectantly and the fish won't show up.,ang
 You don't understand anything I'm saying.,fru
" I did want to see them, I always do. I mean I keep thinking that this is going to be the time and it never is.",ang
 For heavens sake this isn't about fish.,fru
 Do you remember the first time we came to see it? It was about four years ago right after we got married.,sad
" We thought I was pregnant and we opened a bottle of champagne but no glasses, you asked me to dance, we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork.",sad
 And when we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them,sad
" and I remember thinking that this is it you know. At last, at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be",sad
" Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.",sad
 I'd rather not remember some things. I would rather not hope for some things.,sad
 No.,sad
 No.,sad
 No.,xxx
 No.,xxx
 No.,fru
 No.,fru
 No.,fru
 I want something to turn out the way that it supposed to.,fru
" This? What, what is this? This isn't even anything.",fru
" I'm sure, this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, this is fighting.",fru
" Well, but this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.",sad
 I mean it's -- this is just this. I mean it includes a lot and everything but isn't something else. Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?,fru
 I know that Augie. Really I do.,xxx
" I know that you meant this to be special and nice, and there's the sand and the moon and everything but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.",sad
 I didn't say that.,xxx
" For heavens sake, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you.",xxx
 Don't be ridiculous. I mean don't you know that?,hap
" You're the one who probably wishes he was with someone else, someone who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.",sad
" Okay.  Fine, so we're in the wrong spot but we're with the right person.",xxx
" Yes, I noticed that. It looks pretty on the water doesn't it? Big old white moon.",xxx
" Augie, you brought refreshments.",xxx
" Well, I guess we don't need glasses.",hap
 No. No. I think you might be right. I think this may be the spot after all.,xxx
" Augie, I'm sorry.",sad
 Or not.,hap
 Hmm.,neu
 So what do you think?,neu
 What I was saying.,neu
 Certainly it's not. Slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,neu
" Well, I'm not the only one look at all these people.",xxx
 Are we talking about the same thing?,xxx
" Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong but are you having your period?",fru
" Well, what's bugging you?",fru
" There is nothing to it, we come here, the Grunion arrive, then do their little fish business, we go oh ah look, they go home, we go home.",fru
 Why not?,fru
 We've missed them twice; that's not ever.,fru
" Well, we'll see them this year.",neu
 I thought you wanted to see them.,fru
 No of course not.,fru
" It's just fish, I mean nothing to get traumatized over.",xxx
 All right. I've been trying to work this backwards but I cannot seem to pinpoint the moment that we took a turn for the worst.,fru
" You were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was no problem, let's see, I took a shower, you watched the news, you said",neu
" ""the Grunion are running tonight,"" I said ""great, let's go, I feel lucky,""",neu
" okay so I'm getting on my jacket and putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage-",neu
 Wait a minute I've got it,xxx
" It was in the car, right? Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker you said, let's get some champagne and I said times are wasting or something like that, right?",exc
" Of course, I see it now; you want this to be like that other time, right? That's it, right?",exc
" Yea. Okay, sure, no. I see. Listen, you want to dance?",neu
 You want to go get some champagne?,neu
 Take off our shoes?,neu
" What, you want me to breathe in your ear?",xxx
 Get married again?,neu
 What? What? You want a divorce?,fru
 A vacation?,fru
" A new carpet? A poodle, a ice cream, backrub, a suicide pact, what, what Carla, what the hell do you want?",fru
" Well welcome to the human race, all right. Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed? You think I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?",ang
" You think I knew that there be times when you'd look at me like I'm a used Kleenex, or that I'd look at you and think holy hell when is the next flight to Alaska?",xxx
" No, no, just like you I thought it was going to be all like peaches and roses and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three, fat, rosy kids and ha-ha baby the joke is on us",fru
" 'cause you know what you get Carla, you know what you get? This.",fru
" Yes, it is.",xxx
 Right.,xxx
" No, I know. Me neither.",sad
 I'm doing the best I can.,xxx
 Maybe if you were with somebody else too.,sad
" No, I know. But still, I know I don't make you happy.",sad
 Yeah?,xxx
" Now that you mention it. No, I don't.",hap
 I don't know it seemed like a pretty good spot to me. Look at the moon - view the moon view I got from here.,hap
 What have we got here?,hap
 It's not champagne.,xxx
 You still cold? Do you want my jacket? Do you want to go home?,xxx
" Shh, if we're very quiet the fish might come.",hap
 Or not.,hap
 Do you think it's them?,xxx
" Well, nobody knows we're here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.",xxx
 What are we going to do?,exc
 Now and always sweet.,hap
 It's bound to come sooner or later.,xxx
 Oh. It sends shivers down my spine.,exc
 Behave exquisitely.,hap
" Yes, I should probably to a court curtsey.",hap
 What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.,xxx
 It's true; the whole business is a very poor joke.,xxx
 Yes. Meaning just that.,xxx
 Don't laugh at me. I'm serious.,xxx
 Who's they?,exc
" Well, if I laugh at everything then I must laugh at us too.",xxx
" Well, shall we always want to bicker and fight?",xxx
" Oh dear, should we like that?",sad
" Well, what happens if one of us dies, does the one that's left still laugh?",fea
" Well that's serious enough, isn't it?",xxx
" Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.",xxx
" Elliot, worms don't pop.",xxx
" Thank you dear, the same applies you, except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.",xxx
 Which particular one?,hap
" Oh Charles, that was his name Charles. It did wiggle so beautifully.",hap
 I know you did. You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal; I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.,hap
 It went on intermittently for days.,hap
 It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.,hap
 That was the first time you ever hit me.,xxx
 The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.,hap
" Oh it was ridiculous, completely ridiculous.",hap
 And very much sillier.,hap
 Good God.,fea
 I wonder.,xxx
 Must be them then.,fea
" We're all right darling, aren't we whatever happens?",fea
 I don't care then.,xxx
 Hello? Hello? What? Wrong number.,exc
 What do we do if they suddenly walk in on us?,fea
 With the most perfect poise.,hap
" Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's is happy, do they?",hap
 Oh darling don't say that.,sad
 Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love?,hap
 What does it all mean that's what I ask- that's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth?  Good God what does it all mean?,hap
" You mustn't be serious my dear one, that's just what they want.",exc
" All those futile moralists, who try to make life unbearable, laugh at them, be flippant. Laugh at everything all their sacred shibboleths",xxx
 flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness in light.,exc
" Certainly you must, we figures of fun all right.",exc
" No, that desire will fade along with our passion.",sad
 Depends on how well we play it.,xxx
" Yes, yes, with all his might.",exc
" No, no it isn't, death is very laughable, such a cunning little mystery, all done with mirrors.",exc
 So is everyone else in the long run.,exc
" Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers, let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can. Like quite idiotic, very small, school children. Let's savor the delight of the moment.",exc
 Come kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.,exc
" I don't care what you do see. You can paint yourself green and dance naked in the Place Vendome, and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word, as long as you love me best.",xxx
 You remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,hap
" The one when you bought that little, painted, wooden snake in the Piazza and put it on my bed.",xxx
" Horrible thing, I hated it.",xxx
 How long did that row last?,xxx
 The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burned a hole in my new dressing gown.,xxx
" That was a rouser, wasn't it?",hap
 I didn't hit you very hard.,xxx
 I'll never forget his face.,hap
 We were very much younger then.,xxx
 As a matter of fact the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.,xxx
 You knew there was nothing in that.,exc
" Presents, just a trivial little broach.",exc
 No it wasn't. It was very pretty I still have it and I wear it often.,neu
" No I didn't, you worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.",neu
" Just a little perhaps, nothing serious.",xxx
 What of it?,neu
" It gave him a lot of pleasure, it didn't hurt me any.",neu
" Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious you never wouldn't have known anything about it.",neu
 I'm bored of this conversation.,fru
 No thanks.,neu
 I don't see why you want any you've already had two glasses.,xxx
 It just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.,neu
" Well, it's become a habit with you.",neu
 Don't be so stupid.,xxx
 What?,ang
 No I'm just making myself fascinating for you.,neu
 It's a woman's job to allure the man,xxx
" watch me a minute, will you?",xxx
" Oh, no it isn't.",fru
 Be quiet.,ang
 It doesn't seem to work such wonders with you.,xxx
 Adders don't snap they sting.,xxx
 They sting.,xxx
 I don't care. Do you understand? I don't care. I don't care if they bark or roll about like hoops.,ang
" Yes, I did quite a lot.",neu
 Mind your own business.,xxx
 You're quite insufferable. I expect it's because you're drunk.,xxx
 On the contrary a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of Brandy.,xxx
 Oh be quiet.,ang
" Not very funny my dear, you better have some more Brandy.",xxx
 Why?,xxx
 There aren't any people upstairs it's a photographer's studio.,xxx
 They're away in Tunis.,xxx
" Turn it on again, please.",xxx
" Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.",fru
 You are far too temperamental. Try to control yourself.,ang
 Stop it. Stop it. I hate you.,ang
" Listen indeed. I'm sick and tired of listening to you, damn sadistic bully.",ang
" Stop it. Stop it. I hate you, do you hear? You're overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible.",ang
" This is the end, do you hear? The end finally and forever.",ang
 Oh yes I am.,ang
" Yes, I am. Let go of me you're cruel fiend and I hate and loathe you. Thank God I realized who you really are before I would ever, ever marry you again. I would never marry you again. I'd rather die in torment.",ang
 You're a beast. I hate you. Stop it. Stop it.,ang
" As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",neu
 I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.,ang
" Yes, I remember it well, bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.",xxx
 You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,ang
" You must admit he was in love with you, wasn't he?",xxx
 You let him kiss you; you said you did.,ang
 What of it?,xxx
 What about me?,ang
 That's a nice point of view I must say.,xxx
" Yes, me too, bored stiff. You want some Brandy?",xxx
 I have a little I think.,neu
" No particular reason. Anyhow, they are very small ones.",neu
 You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.,neu
 You needn't be so grand just because don't happen want any yourself right now.,xxx
" Really, Amanda.",xxx
 Nothing.,fru
" Going out somewhere, dear?",neu
 That reply has broken my heart.,xxx
" As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.",neu
 Yes it is.,xxx
 It's a pity you didn't have any more Brandy it might have made you a little less disagreeable.,xxx
" Snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.",fru
 Oh nonsense they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.,fru
 They snap.,fru
" Tell me, did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?",neu
 I imagine you let him kiss you good deal more then.,xxx
 What riotous time you must have had.,ang
" No restraint at all, very enjoyable, never had much anyhow.",ang
 I am not in the least drunk.,xxx
" I imagine, as I may have already mentioned, I've had three minute liquor glasses of Brandy the whole evening long a child of two couldn't get drunk on that.",xxx
" Oh very interesting. How about a child of four, a child of six or a child of nine?",xxx
" We can get a good little debate going about that, don't you think? Intemperate tots.",ang
 All right. I will.,neu
 Better turn that off I think.,neu
 Because it's late and it'll annoy the people upstairs.,xxx
 There are people downstairs I suppose?,xxx
 This is no time of the year for Tunis.,xxx
 I'll do no such thing.,fru
 Turn it off it's driving me mad.,xxx
 Turn it off.,ang
" Amanda, listen. Listen.",ang
 Very amusing indeed.,ang
" You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I hope I never see you again as long as I live.",ang
 You're not going like this.,ang
 You're not.,ang
 Shut up.,ang
 Shut up.,ang
 I wouldn't marry you again if you came to me on your bended knees. You're a evil minded little vampire. I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live.,ang
" God, finally I got to the line, the front of the line. I've been waiting there for like half an hour.",xxx
 [BREATHING] It's so hot in here. Hoo.,xxx
 What's wrong?,neu
" No, no, no, no, no, no. The lady over there, she told me to fill out the front and she said to wait in this line.",fru
 I don't know. Some lady. Sonya or something.,fru
" Excuse me? No, no. I waited in the line over there..",fru
 and she told me to come over here and she said to fill out everything on the application and I did that.,fru
" Look, I-- No, no, no, I--you don't understand. I have to go back to work.",fru
 I am not-,fru
 But you don't understand. I cannot get back in line because I have to go back to work. I will get fired if I don't leave here.,fru
 But I was at work and the lady told me to come and work it and to stand in the line.,xxx
 [LAUGHTER],fru
 Yeah.,xxx
" Oh, um-",neu
" You didn't fill this out right. All right. It says that you have to fill out the back sheet of this, but you filled out the yellow sheet of it.",neu
 Who?,neu
 She- she probably doesn't even work here.,neu
 All right  Uh-,neu
 It's not right.,fru
 You just take--all right.,fru
" Well, you didn't fill this paper at work out right and it's going to take another fifteen minutes to do it and look at how long the line we got here so just-",fru
" okay, just go back and fill it out real quick and I'm sorry, you have to get back in line and wait. I can't let you cut.",fru
" Well, maybe you should have got here earlier than so you had a lot of time to do this.",xxx
 I don't know who this lady is.,xxx
" How's it going, babe?",neu
 Yeah?,neu
 Good.,xxx
" Hey listen,eh- I've been wanting to talk to you. I have something to tell you. How's Amy doing?",xxx

 It's going- It's going to be probably in about three weeks.,sad
 yeah,sad
" Well, I'm leaving in three weeks, but-- Yeah.",xxx
 Maybe we can still do that,fru
" Yeah, and uh--",sad
" I know, but look, I have to take this. I mean, if I don't, I mean, I could get fired.",fru
 And we know you need-we need the money. We couldn't even- purchase a house if I didn't take this.,fru
" Honey, I'm going to come back. It's not like that.",sad
 But it- it is for a year.,sad
" Babe, I'm sorry. But I don't want to do.",sad
" You know as much as -as much as me that I-I want to stay here with you and Amy so bad, but I can't.",sad
" But you're so good with her. You know, she knows you better than she knows me 'cause I'm at work every day.",fru
" Babe, I love you.",sad
" But she has you. I mean, that's what you're there for. You're my right-hand man.",sad
 It's going to be okay.,sad
" No, I have to go.",sad
" Wait, you can write me and as you know, send me pictures.",sad
 What do you mean?,sad
" Look, I need you to be strong for me. 'Cause I can't be the only one that's strong right now, really, I--",sad
" But we can work, you know, we--you can write me and we could see pictures",xxx
" and if we survive, if we survive that then babe, you know you know we could survive any--",sad
 I will come back.,sad
 I can do it. I'm going to do it. And I'll be back safe and sound and-,xxx
 we'll have all the money that we ever needed.,sad
 And- And then I'll stop working and- I'll stay home with the baby.,sad
 It's all I ever knew how to do. I can't quit now.,sad

 Don't do that to me.,sad
" It's hard enough already, Brian, I can't.",sad
 I know.,sad
" I didn't expect this to happen. I never planned for this. Some things you just don't plan for, you know.",sad
" I'm sorry, babe.",sad
 I'm so sorry.,sad
 All right.,neu
 She's doing fine. She just took her first steps today actually. I videotaped it for you so you can watch it.,hap

 It doesn't look very good.,sad
 I don't want the money. I want-you here,sad

 If your life is going to be in danger and this family is going to be in danger we don't need the job. We'll find the money.,ang
 How are we supposed to tell Amy? How's she supposed to understand that?,sad
" How is she going to feel the first year in school, no mom.",sad

 I feel like I'm not doing anything. Like I'm not giving anything into this world.,fru
" Yeah, but what if I never make it? What if I studied all my life, this theatre, this acting, and I'm never going to get anywhere. I'm never going to be able to have a job.",fru
 Time is passing by. Every year it's,fru
 a part left than I can do.,fru
 Really?,sur

 That's the thing. I don't know. I don't know anything.,fru
 Law school? Maybe.,fru

 Okay. All I know is that I am supposed to have my language here right now. Right now. And it's not there. And you're supposed to help me because you work at the airport. So give me my luggage or tell me where the hell it is.,fru

 Did you- Did you check with the lost and found?,fru

" Oh, not--we didn't lose it; maybe the airport lost it. Maybe someone stole it.",neu
" No, I mean, maybe in the little--going around thingy thing where bopper stole it from there.",fru
 Okay. What can we do is we can get your name and information and if it shows up we can send it to you so-- Wherever you stay,fru
" Well, I'll have you fill out some paperwork and see if you can get started on something.",fru
" You know, we'll file a complaint and we could possibly, you know, replace some of the things. I think-",xxx
 and when you sign your ticket we could replace about fifteen percent of what's in the bag.,neu
 Up to a limit of twenty five dollars.,neu
" Whoa, maybe you should uh- have thought of a better way to send it than just in a bag, hmm? Did you think about that?",fru
" I think that's kind of stupid, that you put a hundred thousands of dollars in the bag.",neu
 Did you lock- Did you lock it even? You probably didn't even lock it.,fru

" Hello sir, can I help you?",neu
 I [GARBAGE],neu
" Yes, sir, I'm very sorry, but we've had some trouble here.  There's been a lot of calls and the system has-",neu
" Sir, please calm down.  There's no reason to use profanity like that.  It's not-",neu
" Okay, and this is for Verizon? Your provider?",neu
" Well, um- we have a little problem with the system going on.  One of our satellites is down, and I-",neu
" You're going to have to just be patient with us, sir, as we",neu
" Well, I know sir, and we all are busy.",neu
 But I'm going to definitely have to- uh--get your contact information,neu
" Okay, well, if you would like, um- we will be turning on the systems in probably about ten hours.",neu
" Sir, I'm very sorry, but this is the way it is.  This- We have no control over it.  It's going to take-  -but you have to be patient with us.  You can use a calling card.  We will give you a free calling card to use.",neu
" Do you have a land line, sir?",neu
" Okay, well, we will send you- We will reimburse you for the amount of minutes that you-",neu
 -on average would use.,neu
" And we will probably send you a calling card.  I'm very sorry.  You're just going to have to be patient, sir.",neu
" No, we don't just give you things.  We're- we're-",neu
 we compensating you for all your-,neu
" No no, we're not taking anything from you sir.  This is- This is unbeknownst to us.  The problem had just happened.",fru
 The satellite-is down in your area.,fru
" No, three days, sir.  It's not three days. It's- It's only been about a day now. Let's not exaggerate.",fru
 Three days?,neu
 A day?,neu
" I don't know, sir.",neu
" Oh, well, I'm sorry about that. Umm- We-",neu
" Well, ten hours worth of minutes--",neu
 is what's going to happen.,neu
" Sir,",neu
" what I would like what I'm advising you to do now is just to write down all of your problems that you-you feel that--You know, haven't been addressed, fax it to us-",neu
 and we will take care of it if anything happens.  But all we can do now is ask for your patience.,neu
 Okay? Thank you for calling.  Goodbye.,neu
" Hey, you stupid dumb shit machine, give me a fucking operator, huh?",ang
" Yeah, I've been on the-with the machine for like thirty minutes--",xxx
" trying to get an answer, and no one's given me an answer.  So what are you going to do about it?",xxx
" Fuck, do you think I have all day?  Jesus",xxx
" Fine, sorry.  Okay, my phone's been on the fritz for like three days.  I can't get any incoming calls. What- What is going on?",fru
 Yeah.,xxx
 You know what?  I'm just going to- Patient?  I'm a busy man.,ang
" -have to, have to what?",ang
 What?  It's my phone.  You can't even call me on it. I don't have another phone.,ang
 What?  Are you kidding me?,ang
" Oh, my God.",ang
 I- I'm going to kill myself right now.,ang
 A free calling card?,ang
" No, I don't have a land line.",xxx
" That's it? Okay, yeah.  What else?",ang
" Okay, I need more than this.  Are you going to give me a little bit more?",ang
 So you take things from me and you expect me just to wait around.,fru
" Okay, so you think you're going to-  -get me back some minutes, and that's going to make up for three days of business that I lost?  Okay, great.",fru
" No, it's been--three days.",fru
" Fine, it's been a day.  Okay?",fru
 A day's worth of business.  You know how much I make in a day?,xxx
 About three million dollars.,neu
" So, you're going to give me back ten dollars worth of minutes--",xxx
 -to make up the three million dollars.,xxx
" Ten hours? So, basically, a day's worth of minutes which I pay forty dollars a month from it.",xxx
 So you're giving me a dollar back.,xxx
" Oh, my God.",fru
 What's he going to say? Maybe we ought to talk to him before he sees it.,xxx
" What-how did he see it? I mean, I was the first one up. He was still in bed.",xxx
 When?,xxx
 What was he doing out at four in the morning?,xxx
 Did you talk to him?,neu
" He cried hard, huh?",neu
 What was he doing out there at that time? He was dreaming about him again. He's walking around at night again.,xxx
" Could he-he's acting just like he did after he died, you know?",neu
 What's the meaning in that?,xxx
" Well, what do you mean? What?",xxx
" What do you mean, dishonest?",neu
" What, you're going to argue with him?",fru
 You can't tell him that.,fru
 We can't. It just won't work.,fru
 They do come back.,neu
" I know, but he doesn't know that.",xxx
 Three years has been a long time.,xxx
" It's those Goddamn newspapers, you know? I mean, it's like every day they come out with this new person that comes along. And the next one's going to be Larry.",ang
 What?,fru
 Why?,neu
" Well, I have an idea, but go on, tell me, what's the story?",xxx
" Well, that's only your business, Chris.",neu
" Well, it is. I mean, what do you want me to do? You're grown up; you know what's going on in your mind.",fru
" Well, you better make sure your father's not- No- I'm just saying.",fru
" Yeah, well I ignore what I got to ignore.",fru
 And she-she's Larry's girl.,fru
" Well, from your father's point of view she is. I mean, he's still alive. You've got no right to take her.",fru
" If you go on from that point, I don't know where you go.",xxx
" 'Cause listen, I'm telling you, I don't know where to go from there. Do you?",fru
 What do you want from me?,fru
 You're a considerate fella and there's nothing wrong in that.,neu
 There's nothing wrong with it.,neu
 You didn't ask her yet?,fru
" Well, how do you know she's going to marry you? I mean, what if she feels the same way as your father?",xxx
" You know, the trouble is you've never had enough women. No, you never did.",fru
 I don't understand why it has to be her.,fru
" That's a good answer, but it doesn't answer anything.",fru
" I mean, you haven't seen her since the war. I mean, it's been five years.",fru
" No, I don't want a diagram.",fru
" He thinks he's coming back. You go-go on and marry her, I mean, you're pronouncing her dead. And what's going to happen to your father, huh? I don't know. Do you?",fru
" Just, listen. Give it more thought, is all.",fru
 What the hell is this?,xxx
 You're crazy.,xxx
 You're what-you're going to leave the business? But you can't do that. What the hell is this?,fru
" Oh, you have to be inspired.",fru
 Tell me something.,neu
 You'd leave that business.,neu
 You can't do that.,fru
" All right, but you can't do that. You can't talk like that.",fru
" We've worked all our lives for you. Only for you, Chris. The whole shootin' match is for you.",fru
 I'm going to.,neu
 You just can't talk like that.,xxx
" I don't know you, do I?",neu
 Yeah. I can see that.,neu
 He saw it.,neu
 He was out there when it happened.,neu
" Um, about four this morning. Uh- I heard a crack and I looked out and I saw him standing there.",neu
 I don't know. But after it cracked he went back in the house and he cried in the kitchen.,neu
" No, I uh-, I figured the best thing to do was to leave him alone.",neu
 I could hear it right through the floor.,neu
 I guess he is.,neu
 I don't know.,neu
" But I know one thing, mom. We've made a terrible mistake with dad.",neu
 Being dishonest with him. That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.,neu
 You know Larry's not coming back and I know that too. Why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?,xxx
" No, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time that he realized that no one believes that Larry's coming back anymore.",fru
 We got to tell him that.,fru
" You know, for God's sakes it's been three years. No one comes back after three years. It's insane.",fru
" All right. Just- Sit down, mom. I want to talk to you.",fru
" All right. All right. Just come on, sit down.",fru
" You know-you know why I asked Annie here, right?",neu
 You know.,neu
 I want to ask her to marry me.,neu
" Come on, you know that's not only my business.",fru
 So it's all right. I'll just go ahead with it.,neu
" See, then it's not just my business. God, you have",ang
" -Oh, you infuriate me sometimes. You know, it's not just my business too if dad throws a fit.",ang
 God. You have such a talent for ignoring things.,xxx
" No, she is not Larry's girl.",xxx
" Oh, I don't know.",xxx
" Every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole entire life, time and time after time.",sad
 To hell with that.,ang
 I didn't ask Annie yet.,neu
 I wanted to get this settled first.,neu
 Well then I guess it's over then. But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.,neu
" I'll find out. But then after it's all over we'll thrash it out with dad, right?",neu
" Mom, don't avoid me.",fru
 So what? I'm not fast with women.,fru
 Because it is.,neu
 I just-,fru
 It just is. I-,neu
" I grew up with her. Okay. All these years, when I think of someone I want to be my wife I think of Annie. What do you want, a diagram?",fru
" Okay. All right, then.",fru
" No, I've given it three years of thought.",fru
 And I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.,xxx
 But if I can't have that here then I'll get out.,neu
 I'll get out. I'll marry her somewhere else. Maybe New York.,neu
 I've been a sucker too long. I'm through with it.,xxx
 The business. The business doesn't inspire me.,fru
 Yes. I like it an hour out of the day. If I have to grub for money all day long at least that evening I want it beautiful. I want a wife. I want a family. I want some kids. I want to build something I can give myself to.,ang
" Now, Annie's in the middle of all that.",ang
" Now, where do I find it?",neu
 Yes. On this I would.,neu
 Then help me stay here.,neu
 Okay. Just-,neu
" Yeah, I know, I know, just help me stay here, all right?",fru
 I am thinking like that.,neu
" No, you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy.",neu
 Why did you invite her here?,ang
 She's been in New York for three-and-a-half years. She don't just suddenly come and-,ang
 You don't travel seven hundred miles just to see.,ang
 He's not going to marry her.,xxx
 It's got that about it.,ang
" What's going on here, Joe?",xxx
 She's not Larry's girl. She knows that.,ang
 Then why is she married? Then why isn't she married? She's been in New York and there's hundreds of single men there.,xxx
" I'm sure hundreds of them asked her and told her that she's foolish, but no.",xxx
 She's waited.,xxx
" Because she thinks like me, that's why.",xxx
" She's faithful as a rock, don't you know. In my worst moments I can think of her-",sad
" I think again, that I'm-I'm right.",xxx
" Nobody in my house better ever dare-dare to challenge her faith. Maybe strangers, but not his father, not his brother.",ang
 Because he's not coming back. Then what do I got to live for? I'll kill myself.,xxx
" Don't, don't laugh at me, don't laugh at me.",ang
" Look at it. Because why, when she came here and she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Look at it, look at it, Joe.",ang
" You got to believe, believe with me because I can't stand all alone.",xxx
" No, you've got to believe.",sad
" Believe, Joe. You above all people have got to believe.",xxx
 You got to keep believing.,sad
 I can't help it.,sad
 Why? Does that bother you?,xxx
" Well, maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her.",neu
" What do you mean? They lived next door to each other their entire lives. Why shouldn't he want to see her? Hey, don't look at me like that. I don't know anymore than you do.",xxx
 How do you know he's even thinking about it?,neu
" Well, so what?",neu
" Listen, kid-",fru
 You can't read her mind.,neu
 How do you know why she's waited?,neu
" Look, it's a nice day. What are we arguing for?",neu
 Calm yourself.,neu
 Calm yourself.,fru
 All right. All right. Calm yourself.,ang
 Okay. Just calm yourself.,fru
" Why me, above all?",ang
 Huh?,ang
 Why me above all?,ang
" Look at you, you're shaking.",ang
 What have I got to hide?,ang
" Huh? What the hell's the matter with you, Kate?",ang
 You're the only one I know that still loves his parents.,hap
" No, it's all right. There's nothing wrong in that, you know.",hap
 It's really lovely here. The air is sweet.,hap
 No. I'm not sorry. It's-,sad
 I can't stay.,xxx
" Well, for one thing, your mother so much has told me to go. [LAUGHTER].",fru
" Look,",xxx
" you've been acting kind of, well, you know.",xxx
" Well, you've been embarrassed ever since I came.",sad
 Yeah.,xxx
" Yeah, they would. Especially your mom.",xxx
" Well, I mean,",hap
" from her opinion, why else would I come here?",hap
" Well, I guess that's why I came.",hap
" I've been ready for a long, long time.",hap
 Look,xxx
 I was almost married two years ago.,xxx
 'Cause you started to write me.,xxx
 Every day since.,hap
" Well, I don't know, you didn't write until then and then when you did, what'd you say?",xxx
 You always can be so ambiguous.,xxx
 I don't know if I ever can forgive you for that. Why'd you wait so long? I sat in my room wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you.,hap
" Not like that, you're not.",xxx
" Like Larry's brother. Do it like you, Chris.",hap
 What is it?,xxx
 No. What is it? Is it your mother?,sad
" Well then tell me what's wrong. I mean, even in your letters there's something ashamed.",sad
 You should tell me.,sad
" But, Chris, it wouldn't work like this.",sad
" Yeah, sure.",sad
 How many?,sad
 Geez.,sad
 And you still feel that way?,sad
" Because you can't feel that way, never again, Chris. You hear me? Never. I mean, the money and me too.",sad
" I mean, there's nothing wrong in that money, and your father put good planes up in the air and you should be proud of that. A man should be paid for that.",xxx
 What am I going to do with a fortune?,hap
" Yeah. I know. It went out of style, didn't it?",hap
 You're not sorry you came?,neu
 Why not?,xxx
 Well-,neu
 What?,neu
" Yes, I guess I have been. But it's going from me now.",xxx
" Oh look, um, well, the thing is, I was planning on, planning on sort of sneaking up on you over a week or so, and they-they take it for granted we're all set.",hap
 How did you know?,xxx
" Well, uh- would you want to?",xxx
" I, I guess that's why I asked you to come.",hap
" Oh, Annie.",hap
" Annie, I love you.",hap
 I love you a great deal.,hap
 I-I love you. I have no imagination. That's all I know how to tell it.,hap
" I'm embarrassing you. I didn't want to tell you it here. I wanted to go somewhere that would be brand-new to each other. It feels wrong here, don't you? This yard and this chair.",hap
 I don't want to win you from anybody. I want you to be ready for me.,hap
 Then he's gone forever. You're sure?,xxx
 Why didn't you?,sur
 You felt something that far back?,hap
 Why didn't you let me know?,hap
" Give me a kiss, Annie.",hap
 Give me-,hap
" [LAUGHTER]. God, I kissed Annie. I kissed Annie. How long, how long I've been waiting to kiss you.",xxx
 We're going to live now. I'm going to make you so happy.,hap
 I kissed you.,hap
 Let's drive somewhere. I want to be alone with you.,sad
" No, no, no, no. Nothing like that.",neu
" Yeah. I guess there is. I guess I was, but uh- it's going from me now.",sad
 I don't know where to start.,sad
 You know when I went overseas. I said I was in command of a company.,sad
" Well, I lost them.",sad
 Just about all.,sad
 It takes a little while to toss that off. Because they weren't just men.,sad
" For instance, one time, it had to have been raining several days. There was this one kid, he came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks. Put them in my pocket.",sad
" I mean, that's-that's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had. They didn't just die. They killed themselves for each other. And I mean that exactly. A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.",sad
" And I, and I thought something watching them go down.",sad
" Everything was being destroyed, see, but there was one new thing that was being created. A kind of responsibility, man for man. You understand me?",sad
 And to show that-to bring that onto the earth like some sort of monument standing right behind us where everyone could feel it and it would make a difference to him.,sad
 And I came back here and it was incredible. There was no meaning in that here. The whole thing to them was a bus accident.,sad
 And I went to work with dad and that rat race again. And I felt what you said-ashamed somehow. Because nobody was changed at all. It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.,sad
" And I felt wrong to be alive. To drive the car, to see the new checkbook, to see the new refrigerator. I mean, you can take those things out of the war. But you got to know that when you drive that car that that came out of the love a man can have for another man. And you got to be a little bit better because of that.",sad
" Otherwise, what you have here is loot; and there's blood on it.",sad
 And I didn't want to take any of it.,sad
 And I guess that included you.,sad
" I want you now, Annie.",xxx
" Annie,",hap
" Annie, I'm going to make a fortune for you.",hap
 Fine.,sad
 What flashlight?,xxx
 That's not your flashlight; it's ours. It's mine too.,xxx
" I don't understand why you're always saying oh, it's mine, it's mine. It's not like it's just your flashlight. I mean, how do you think that makes me feel?",ang
 Yes.,xxx
 I'm cold.,xxx
" It's past eleven, let's go home.",xxx
 There is no point in coming down here.,xxx
 That's my point.,xxx
" Well, so let's go.",xxx
 Not particularly.,sad
 I don't know. I just don't.,sad
 Pass up what? A bunch of fish. They swim up to the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.,ang
" I don't know why you're getting so excited. I mean, it's not like the landing of the moon or something. It's just fish. Fish that nobody eats.",fru
" Oh, God, Augie.",fru
" I'm just not. I mean, I'm sorry, it just-they're still fish to me.",xxx
 Yes.,xxx
" Yes, and if you also remember, I got sand in my panties. We got into an argument about nothing. You got a sore throat and we never saw the grunions.",fru
" No, for God's sakes, we've never seen the grunions. We're not going to see them.",fru
" Yeah, that's the wind.",xxx
 About what?,xxx
 It's ridiculous.,xxx
" Hey, what time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight, right? God, this is great, isn't it?",exc
 Look at the night we got; couldn't be better.,exc
" You know actually, I wanted to go a little further up the coast to get away from all the, the people and the lights, and uh- but I thought we'd miss it. Hey, how you doing?",exc
" Oh, is that-is that-now, is that just foam, uhh, I can't even tell.",exc
" Oh, though if I can't tell it probably isn't them, right? It probably would be unmistakable, wouldn't you think? Hey, how you doing?",exc
" Oh, do you know what I forgot? I forgot my flashlight. How could I be so stupid. Oh, I-I should have brought my flashlight.",exc
" Uh- you know, the flashlight. The silver one. There's only one, isn't there?",exc
" Oh, well, sure.",xxx
" No, of course. Yours and mine. Our flashlight. Yours and mine. Mi flashlight is su flashlight. Naturally.",xxx
 We should have brought our flashlight. I can't believe we forgot to bring it.,exc
 I hope the moon stays out.,exc
" Hey, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year. Do you remember?",exc
 Are you cold? Do you want my jacket?,xxx
" We should have brought the blanket. Oh, why didn't we bring the blanket? Our blanket.",exc
" You know what would be good right now? A six-pack. Ah, I can't believe I forgot a six-pack. A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now.",exc
 I'm so stupid. I'm like a little kid. I-it's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh- [LAUGHTER].,exc
 I wonder if they can hear us talk. Or hear the vibrations in the sand when we move.,exc
 Do you want my jacket?,neu
 What? Are you kidding me? We just got here. We'd miss it. What's the point of coming down there if we just turn around and go home?,sur
 Right.,neu
" Yeah, that's my point too.",neu
" No. No, no, no, that's not my point. My point is there's no point in coming down here if we just turn around and leave.",exc
" I mean, don't you want to see it?",neu
 Why not?,neu
" Honey, this is a natural-this is a natural phenomenon. I mean, it only happens once a year. This is, this is a great opportunity. Think about the people in Kansas. They would have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservation to come and see this. We're only forty minutes away. This is too good to pass up.",xxx
 Yeah. But that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. And all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you-spawning or mating or something like that.,xxx
" I mean, this is the big night for these guys. Life's last orgy.",xxx
" Yeah, they do.",xxx
" What, okay, then it's fish that do something no other fish do. Like the swallows in Capistrano or the lemmings who throw themselves off the cliffs.",xxx
" There's magic here and mystery and a little bit of the unexplainable. I mean, I don't see how you cannot be interested.",xxx
 For real?,sur
 I don't get it. The last time-the first time that we came to see it you said it was the best night of your life.,xxx
 And then last year when we came to see it you ran out of the house so fast that you stubbed your toe. And you didn't even notice until you got in the car.,xxx
 We weren't in a good spot.,xxx
" We just weren't in a good spot, all right? This is a much better spot. I have a good instinct for these things. Look, is that-",fru
" no, that's just seaweed, isn't it? This is great, isn't it?",xxx
" I wouldn't miss this for anything. I mean, think about this. Okay, I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute.",exc
 Somewhere out there there's this huge silver mass of fish heading this way. They don't know why. And we don't know why. Just some little instinctual time-release firecracker went off-went off in their bodies.,xxx
" And they all, all as one, turned as one and formed this line as big as the California coast and started swimming this way. Swimming as if that's the only thing that matters.",exc
" You know, they didn't ask it a question. They didn't, they didn't take a vote. They didn't have an invitation or a map; they just started swimming as one.",exc
" its single-mindedness with one mind. Urgency that's pure urge. You know, they don't give it a name.",exc
" They don't ask it a question. They just, they just, they don't know what drives them. They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them to here",exc
" where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death. Oh, God, I'm giving myself goosebumps. Look, I'm all-all my hairs on my arms is sticking up.",exc
 So what do you think?,xxx
 About what I just said.,neu
 About what?,neu
 It's ridiculous.,xxx
" It's so P.R. I mean, somebody's giving you a good bill about this wonderful event that's going to happen on the beach.",xxx
 Exactly. Everyone else is told the same thing. It keeps them feeling excited. Keeps them coming back. Keeps them thinking life's going to start at any minute now.,xxx
 I don't care. It's still fish to me.,xxx
" Augie, Goddamn it, don't ask me that. You always ask me that. Why do you ask me that? I hate it. It's insulting.",ang
" Look, it's-we just-we're looking at this evening in a different way, both of us. We both have different ideas of it.",fru
 It's not like that.,xxx
" Look, Augie, we've never seen them. They're never going to come.",fru
 Twice is as many times as we've tried. That's ever.,xxx
" No, we won't.",xxx
" It's impossible. It's like waiting around. Waiting to see Santa Claus, you know?",xxx
 Like I feel like my whole life I've been just standing on this beach with my hands clasped waiting for these fish to show up and these fish never show up.,ang
 I do.,fru
" Look, I did. I always do. But it's like every time I try nothing ever happens.",fru
" For God's sake, Augie, this is not about fish.",fru
 Do you remember the last time we came here?,sad
 We thought I was pregnant.,sad
 You brought a bottle of champagne.,sad
 We took off our shoes and we danced barefoot in the sand. Under the moon.,hap
 And you whispered so intimately in my ear so I could feel your words.,hap
" Oh, that moment-that was it.",hap
" I told myself finally, this is how happy I'm supposed to be.",sad
 Dancing barefoot in the sand. Drinking out of a bottle of champagne.,hap
 I don't want to remember something.,sad
 Hope for some things.,sad
 No.,sad
 No.,sad
" No, no.",sad
 No.,fru
 No.,fru
 No.,ang
 No.,fru
 I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be.,fru
 This what? What is this? This is nothing.,fru
" No, it's not. It's standing on the beach waiting and fighting.",ang
 Things have never turned out anything the way that I thought they would be.,sad
" I mean, this is, this is everything, and it's a lot, but",xxx
 it's not something else. Do you know what I'm trying to say?,sad
" I know you are, Augie, and I know you wanted this evening to be nice, but I can't help thinking of being somewhere else.",sad
 I didn't say that.,sad
" Augie, anything I do I'd rather be doing with you.",fru
" God, don't you know that? I mean, you're the one that probably wants to be with somebody else. Somebody that didn't take herself so seriously, could enjoy herself more.",fru
" Well, I guess we're just in the wrong spart-spot with the right person.",hap
 I noticed that. It's beautiful.,hap
 You can see right over the water.,hap
" God, big old white moon.",xxx
 You brought refreshments?,xxx
 At least we won't need glasses.,hap
 So I was thinking you might be right.,xxx
 Maybe this is the right place after all.,hap
" I'm sorry, Augie.",sad
 Or not.,xxx
 So what do you think?,xxx
 About what I was just saying.,neu
 It certainly is not. It is slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,fru
" Well, I'm not the only one. Look at all these people.",fru
 Are we talking about the same thing?,fru
" Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period?",neu
" Okay, then what's bugging you?",fru
" There's nothing to it, alright? We come down here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish, and then they go home and we go home.",fru
 We're not seeing the grunions?,neu
 We missed them twice. That's not ever.,fru
 We'll see them this time.,fru
" God, I thought you wanted to see it.",fru
 It's just fish. Nothing to get traumatized over.,fru
" I've been turning this thing over in my head trying to figure out when the point was when we took a turn for the worse, and I can't seem to pinpoint it.",fru
" You were fine during the phone call from Marge. Dinner was okay. Doing the dishes was no problem. Let's see. I took a shower. You were watching the news. You said Augie, I think the grunion are running. I said great, let's go. I feel lucky tonight.",fru
" And so I'm getting the animals, putting the animals out in the yard. I'm putting on my jacket, getting the car out of the garage-",fru
 Wait a minute. I got it.,neu
" It was driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, right? You said let's get some champagne, and I said time's-a-wasting or something like that.",xxx
" You want this to be like the other time, right? That's it. Right?",xxx
" Right. I got it. Of course. Listen, do you want to dance?",xxx
 Do you want me to get some champagne?,xxx
 Take off our shoes?,xxx
 What? What? Do you want me to breathe in your ear?,fru
 Do you want to get married again? What? What? Do you want to get a divorce?,fru
 A vacation?,fru
 A new carpet? A poodle?,fru
" A-a back rub, some ice cream, a suicide pact. What the hell do you want, Carla?",ang
" Jesus, welcome to the human race.",fru
 Did you think this is how I thought it was going to turn out? Do you think I had some great fantasy down the line? That four years down the line that we'd come to the beach and argue with each other over fish?,xxx
" No, I was just like you. I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great. And the wind in our hair and the sand in our toes, and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves, and we'll have three big fat rosy kids. And oh God.",fru
" You know what you get? The jokes on us, baby. Because do you know what you get? Huh? Carla? Do you know what you get? You get this.",fru
" Yes, it is.",fru
 Right.,fru
" No, I know. Me neither.",fru
" Well, I'm doing the best I can.",fru
" Yeah, maybe if you were with someone else too.",fru
" No, I know. But I know I don't make you happy.",xxx
 Yeah?,sur
" Actually now that you mention it, no, I don't.",hap
" Seemed like a pretty good spot to me. I mean, look at the view of the moon we've got from here.",hap
 Look what we got here.,hap
 It's not champagne.,hap
 Are you still cold? Do you want to go home?,neu
 Shh.,neu
 If we're very quiet the fish might come.,hap
 Or not.,hap
 [BREATHING],neu
 Do you think it's them?,neu
" I mean, nobody knows we're here except for Freda and she wouldn't ring up.",fea
 What are we to do?,fea
" Yes. Now and always, sweet.",xxx
 It was bound to come sooner or later.,xxx
" [LAUGHTER] God, it sent shivers up my spine.",xxx
" Um terrible thing is one can't stay happy. Well, it's true. I mean, the whole business is a very poor joke.",xxx
" Yes, meaning just that.",xxx
 Don't laugh at me. I'm serious.,exc
 Who's they?,xxx
" Well, if I laugh at everything I'm going to have to laugh at us too.",xxx
" So how long is it going to last? This ludicrous, overbearing love of ours?",xxx
 Shall we always want to bicker and fight?,xxx
" Oh dear, well, shall we want that?",sad
" Well, what if happens if one of us is to die? Does the one that's left still laugh?",sad
" Well, that's serious enough.",xxx
" Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.",xxx
" Elliott, worms don't pop.",xxx
" Thank you, dear. The same applies to you. Except that if I ever so much as catch you looking at another woman I'll kill you.",exc
 Which particular one?,xxx
 Oh Charles. That was his name. Charles. He did wiggle so beautifully.,hap
 I know you did. You threw it out the window and into the Grand Canal. I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.,xxx
 It went on intermittently for days.,xxx
" Well, I burnt a hole in my comb too, and all the towels in the bathroom. [LAUGHTER].",xxx
 yeah. And that was the first time you ever hit me.,hap
 The manager came in and found us rolling on the floor and biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER],hap
 I know. Oh man. Couldn't believe it.,exc
" Yeah, and very much sillier.",xxx
 Oh.,xxx
 Good God.,xxx
 I wonder.,xxx
 It must be them then.,xxx
" We're all right, aren't we darling? Whatever happens.",neu
 Then I don't care.,neu
" Hello? Hello? What? Ugh, wrong number.",xxx
" things that should matter dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy, do they?",exc
" Ooh darling, don't say that.",xxx
" You mean that sacred and beautiful thing, love?",xxx
 What does it all mean? That's what I ask myself in my quest for ultimate truth. What does it all mean?,xxx
" [LAUGHTER]. You mustn't be serious, my dear one, that's what they want.",exc
 All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable. Laugh at them. Be flippant. Laugh at all the sacred shibboleths. Flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.,xxx
" Ooh, certainly you must. We're figures of fun, all right.",exc
 Who knows?,xxx
 No. The fire will fade along with our passion.,xxx
 Depends on how well we play it.,xxx
" Yes, yes. Yes, he must with all his might.",xxx
" No. No, it isn't. Death's very laughable. A cunning little mystery. All done with mirrors.",xxx
 So is everyone else in the long run. Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.,xxx
" Let's blow strumpets, blow-blow trumpets and squeakers and party as much as we can like small quite idiotic school children. Let's savor the delight of the moment. Come, kiss me darling, before worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.",exc
" I don't care what you do, see? As long-you can paint yourself bright green all over and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best.",xxx
 Remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,exc
 The one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it in my bed.,xxx
 Horrible little thing. I hated it.,xxx
 How long did that row last?,xxx
 The worst one was in Cannes when your-your curling iron burnt a hole in my dressing gown.,xxx
" That was a rouser, wasn't it?",exc
 I didn't hit you very hard.,xxx
" Oh, I will never forget his face. Ooh-rah [LAUGHTER].",xxx
 We were very much younger then.,xxx
" Oh, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",xxx
 You knew there was nothing in that.,xxx
 Presents? It was only a small trivial little broach.,xxx
 Not at all. It was very pretty. And I wear it all the time. I still have it.,xxx
" No, I didn't. You made that up all in your jealous imagination.",xxx
" Just a little perhaps, but it was nothing serious.",neu
" Well, what of it?",xxx
" Oh come on, it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't harm me.",xxx
" Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey you'd have never known anything about it.",xxx
" Well, it's true.",neu
" I definitely, most definitely am.",xxx
" No, thanks.",xxx
 I don't see why you want it; you've already had two glasses.,xxx
 I don't see what's the point of going on and on about something like this.,xxx
 It's become a habit with you.,neu
 Don't be so stupid.,ang
 What?,ang
 No. Just making myself fascinating for you.,xxx
" It's a woman's job to allure the man. Watch me, won't you, a minute?",neu
" No, it isn't.",ang
" No, it's not. I don't care.",xxx
" Well, it didn't seem to do such wonders with you, now did it?",xxx
" Adders don't snap, they sting.",fru
 They sting.,fru
" I don't care. I don't care, do you understand? I don't care if they bark, if they roll over on the floor like hoops.",ang
" Yes, I did, quite a lot actually.",xxx
 Mind your business.,fru
 You are quite insufferable. I suppose it's because you're drunk.,ang
 You've always had a weak head.,fru
" On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",xxx
 Do shut up. Shut up.,fru
 I don't want to talk about this anymore.,fru
 Why?,xxx
 There aren't any people upstairs. It's a photographer's studio.,xxx
 They're away in Tunis.,xxx
" Turn it on again, please.",xxx
 Turn it on.,ang
 You've always had far too temperamental for yourself. You should try to control it.,xxx
 I will not. Go away. Go away. I hate you.,ang
" Listen, indeed. No, no, no, no. I am sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.",ang
" Stop it, stop it, I hate you, I loath you, you are overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible.",ang
 This is the end. Do you hear? The end. Now and forever.,ang
" Oh, yes I am.",ang
" Yes I am. Let go of me. I hate you and I loath you. God, I can't believe I just finally realized how you are. I am never marry you. Never. Never, never, never. I would rather die in torment.",ang
" Beast or brute cad, swine beast beast brute.",ang
" As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",ang
 I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.,ang
 I remember it well. Bristling with diamonds. In the worst possible taste.,ang
 You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,xxx
 You must admit that he was in love with you.,xxx
 You let him kiss you. You said so.,ang
 What of it?,xxx
 What about me?,ang
" That's a nice point of view, I must say.",ang
 Are you bored with this conversation?,neu
 So am I. Bored stiff. Want some brandy?,neu
" I'll have a little, I think.",neu
" No particular reason. Anyhow, they were very small ones.",neu
" Oh, my-you can hardly call three minute liquor glasses in the evening going on and on and on.",xxx
 You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want some yourself at the moment.,ang
" Really, Amanda.",ang
 Nothing.,ang
" Going somewhere, dear?",ang
 That reply has broken my heart.,xxx
" As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.",xxx
" Yes, it is.",ang
 It's a pity you didn't have more brandy. It might have made you a little less disagreeable.,xxx
" Oh, snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.",xxx
" Yes, they do. They have a big bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.",xxx
 They snap.,ang
" Uhh,",xxx
 did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,ang
" I imagine that you let him kiss you quite a bit more then, didn't you?",ang
 You had a riotous-must have had a riotous time. No restraint at all. Very enjoyable. You never had much anyhow.,ang
 I'm not in the least bit drunk.,ang
" Okay. As I mentioned before, I said I had three very minute liquor glasses. That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk.",ang
" Oh, very interesting indeed. How about a child of four or a child of six or a child of nine. We might have a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots.",xxx
 You better turn that off.,xxx
 It's very late and it will annoy the people upstairs.,xxx
" Well, I suppose the people downstairs then.",ang
 This is no time of the year for Tunis.,neu
" No, I will do no such thing.",xxx
 No.,xxx
 Turn it off.,ang
" Oh, very amusing, indeed. Amanda, listen-",ang
 Very amusing indeed.,ang
" You know, you're a vile, ill-tempered, wicked little beast and I hope that I never see you again as long as I live.",ang
" No, you're not going out like this. No you're not.",ang
" Oh, shut up. Shut up. Shut up.",ang
" I wouldn't marry you again if you came back crawling to me on your hands and knees because you're vile. You're a mean, evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never set eyes on you again.",ang
 Is that a demand sir?,neu
 I must see it before I just take it.,xxx
" Sir, you completely filled this out wrong.",fru
 No.  You filled out the back part.  You were supposed to fill out the front portion only.,neu
" No, no, no, no, no.  You're going to have to go back over on the other side-- --second door, up the stairs...",fru
 No I can't just transfer it myself sir.  You got to do this.  Everyone else is doing the same thing.,fru
 Excuse me sir?,fru
 I think you're being a little condescending.,fru
 You need to go back over there and fill it out again.,fru
" No, no, no, because there are other people in line.  You have to go get a complete new application.",fru
" No, no, no. Sir,you need to get out of the line--",xxx
" Well I'm going to have to call- security because sir, you- there are hundreds of people waiting in line at this D.M.V.-- --We're closing in about half an hour...",xxx
" You will get your license, sir, you have to go fill out-- --another copy...excuse me?",fru
 No.  Now I'm going to take this from you because you are obviously misleading,xxx
 No.  You couldn't go get another one.,xxx
 Well then you won't have a license will you?,xxx
 Well not from this department you won't.,fru
 Sir-,fru
 Sir?  I'm going to ask you one more time and then I'm going to call my supervisor,fru
 who will proceed to call-- security if you can't remove yourself--,fru
 Really?,fru
" She's not actually in the building.  She's only on the phone. Sir, please leave this line immediately.",fru
 Okay.  I'm going to call security. Security!,ang
" I have it.  I'm taking it.  Doesn't mean I'm going to do anything with it.--Get out of my line!  This is my line.  Get out.  All these people--Sir, you are causing a mob in this department.",xxx
" No, You cannot get your license.  You filled out the wrong part of the form.",fru
" This entire time you're fighting with me sir, you could've finished the form and already been half way-- No.  Get out.",ang
" Hey listen here missy, I've been in this line for an hour and now I'm finally here.  So you're going to take my application.",fru
 It's not a demand it's a request.  Will you just take it?  Come on.,fru
 Oh.  Look at it.,xxx
 What?,xxx
 What are you talking about?  It says fill out that part.,ang
 Okay.,fru
 Oh my God. Can you just transfer it yourself?,fru
 You don't know! you can't write?  You don't know how to write?,fru
 What's wrong with you people?  God.,fru
 The information is on there.  Here I'll just fill it out right here.,fru
" This will take like a minute, okay? Jesus.",fru
 I'm not going anywhere.  I'm staying right here.,ang
" Hey,uh-- Well that's too bad cause I'm getting my license right now.",ang
 Give me my--,fru
" Hey, no, give me that back.",ang
 -- No.  I'm not waiting...I'm not coming back again.  I don't have time to come back five days.,ang
 I'll have a license.,fru
 Yes I will.  I'll have this [GARBAGE],ang
 just as I want.  Ugh.,fru
 Fine.  Call your supervisor.  Ask supervisor over,ang
 and I'll tell her how you've been behaving.,fru
 How would you like that hmm?,fru
" Oh, okay.  Wow.",fru
 No.  I'm not going anywhere.  I'm staying here-- I am filling out right now okay just calm down. I'm filling out right now-- Just take the god damn piece of paper.,ang
 Okey This is a new one.  Take the new one.,xxx

 I'm sorry she's--these people they just want to get their license--,fru
 What are you talking about?  Just transfer it over.  I filled out the new one.,xxx
 I did finish one.  Take it.,ang

 Um.,hap
" How's it- going?  Oh I'm so tired.  Oh, I just woke up. Mmm.",xxx

 You can say no?,fru
 You could.  You really could.  You could-- --get into another line of work.  I could start working after Anna's born?,fru

 Happiness for me is having you here with me,xxx
" and watch our child grow, see her take her first steps, her first words.",sad
 You said two years.,sad
 A whole year? --We're not talking about like a couple months here.  I mean this is a whole year.,sad
 What could happen in a year?,sad
 And this isn't the first time you know?  I mean you always...sending you off to different places and...,sad

" Joe I'm serious I don't want to have to have a little girl to tell...asking every day where's daddy, where's daddy and have to tell her that he's away--",sad

 Well that's the kind of work I'm in honey.,sad

 [LAUGHTER] So nasty. No you... dirty me?,exc
 Okay.,xxx
 She actually asked if it was real?  I would've probably asked the same thing considering you were in Chuck E. Cheese.,hap
 Because of Chuck E. Cheese?,xxx

" Oh god! You are damn cheap, cheap, cheap. Anyways, moving on. It's not like you're poor.  I mean your dad makes... okey",hap

 No I did not drop my phone in water.  I'm not five years old and just dropped my phone anywhere I see it.  Okay this is my business.,ang
 Okay?  And it [GARBAGE]. My business is failing because my phone isn't working and I don't have a land line and I really can't handle this right now.,fru
" the symptoms- This [GARBAGE] a doctor's office. I'm not receiving calls...I can't receive- no, it's, it cuts me off--",fru
 Yes the phone turns on.  No I mean I'm using it not turning on the phone.  Of course it turns on.,fru
 No- I don't have a sim card because it's Verizon and you guys don't use sim cards.,fru
" Okay no.  Sir, this is the deal.  My phone isn't working and I don't care what the problem is but it needs to work.  That's why I'm paying you guys to fix it.",fru
 I don't know even how to use that stuff it's too complicated.  I just want my flip phone to work----that's all I need,fru
" Look, I am on the road all the time.  Do you understand how important?  I'm a woman, a single mother by herself working...what?",fru
" Brent Backersen, I am writing this down, Brent Backersen.  Alright.",fru
" I, I, I don't want a contract. Okay. I don't want any contracts.",fru
 Really?  No contract?,fru
 I want the best freaking camera phone there is though.  I want the really good kind--,xxx
 And palm pilot.,xxx
 And charger and accessories and I want a cover that's pink.,xxx
 no,xxx
" Alright. Well-  I guess - I guess that's okay but,",neu
 you better promise me.,xxx
 Okay.,neu
 Alright Thanks.,neu
 Hello?,neu
 I'm sorry ma'am.  What's the nature of your problem?  But first can I get you to tell me your first and last name?,neu
 I know I just need to verify every time.  I'm sorry.,neu
 Alright Ms. Brown what's the nature of your problem?,neu
 Oh.  I'm sorry. Um- Did you drop it in water?,neu
" Um- well it's probably easy.  Can you any more symptoms either you're not receiving calls----ok, you're not receiving calls, not getting calls.",neu
 Is the phone turned on?,neu
" Well, um- okay.  Your sim card is in- didn't fall out-",neu
 Alright.  Um- Well that could be the problem. cause--,neu
 you might have an older phone where we would use sim cards but probably not.,neu
 Okay.  How about this we'll send you a brand new camera phone with palm pilot-- and-,neu
" So we'll send it- And we'll give you, how about a free year's service?",neu
 Tell them my name.  My name is Brent Backersen.,neu
 Okay.  Tell them my - my ID number is two one three five.,neu
" Tell them that.  You can go in, get a brand new phone, they'll hook you up with service even give you a free three months--",neu
 It will be free.  No contract okay?,neu
" Go in there, yeah, go in there.  Tell them Brent Backersen sent you.",neu
" the top of the line camera phone, game boy, anything you want. For free. And palm pilot.",neu
 They might only have orange.,neu
" Okay.  They can figure out pink for you.  So go in there and just tell them that and they'll hook you up with other goodies, stuff like that free service, no contract, no nothing.  Just for being a good customer",neu
 and battling through with us.,neu
 Yes.  You just tell them Brent Backersen sent you.,neu
 Alright?  Great.  Have a nice evening.,neu
 What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to talk to him before he sees it.,neu
" What do you mean. He couldn't have seen it. I was the first one up, he was still in bed.",sur
 When?,sur
 Well what was he doing out at four in the morning?,xxx
 Did you talk to him?,sad
 He cried hard?,sad
" God, what was he doing out there anyway?",xxx
 Starting to dream about him again.  He's walking around at night again.,fru
" He's getting just like he did after he died, you know?  What, what, what's the meaning of this?",sad
 What?,xxx
 What do you mean dishonest?,xxx
 What are you going to do?  You want to argue with him?,xxx
 You can't say that to him.,xxx
 How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?,fru
" To you maybe, to me, but not to your father.  I mean,",xxx
 he still thinks he's alive still.  I mean you could talk yourself blue in the face and there's no body and there's no grave so where are you?,fru
 No.  It's his god damned newspapers is what it is.  Now every month there's a new boy comes home and Larry's going to be the next one.,ang
 Why?,ang
 Well I have an idea but I don't know.  What's the story?,xxx
 Well that's your business Chris.,xxx
" Well what do you want me to do?  I mean, you're old enough to know your own mind.",ang
" Well, I mean, you got to make sure your dad's not going--",neu
 Well I'm just saying--,fru
 You know I ignore what I got to ignore.,xxx
 She's not...she's Larry's girl.,xxx
 From your father's point of view he is still alive and if you try and take her that's just not fair.  You can't do that.,fru
" And-And-And if you go on from there if you know already to go on from there, then you can.  But I'm telling you something that I don't know where to go.  You got it?  I mean, do you?",fru
 You're a considerate fellow.  There is nothing wrong in that.,xxx
 Did you ask Annie yet?,neu
 And what if she doesn't marry you huh?  What if she feels the same way your father does?,xxx
" Look, you never had seen many, many women.  You know?  I mean...",neu
 Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.,fru
" Well that's a good answer but, it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you left to go to the war and it's been five years.",xxx
 No I don't want a diagram.,fru
" He thinks he's coming back. And you go off and marry that girl and you're just pronouncing him dead and what's going to happen to him?  I don't know.  Do you?  I mean, I don't know.",fru
" Look, just give it some thought okay?",xxx
 What the hell is this?,xxx
 Are you crazy?,xxx
 You're just going to leave the business?  You have a business here.  You can't do that.,ang
" Oh, you have to be inspired.",xxx
 Tell me something.  You can leave this business?,sad
 You can't talk like that.,xxx
 Alright but you can't talk like that you hear?,fru
" I mean what the hell have we worked for then?  I mean, it's all for you Chris.  The whole shooting match is for you.",ang
 Alright but you don't talk like that you hear?  You don't.,fru
 I don't understand you do I?,sad
 Yeah.  I can see that.,sad
 He saw it.,sad
 He was out there when it happened.,sad
 About four in the morning.  I heard a crack and I looked out and he was standing right there when it happened.,sad
 I don't know. But after it cracked he ran back into the house and he cried in the kitchen.,sad
 No.  I figured the best thing to do was leave him alone.,sad
 I could hear it right through the floor.,sad
 I guess he is.,sad
" I don't know.  But I know one thing mom, we made a terrible mistake with dad.",sad
 Being dishonest with him.  That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.,fru
 You know that Larry's not coming back and I know that too.  Why we both go on letting him think that we both believe with him.,ang
" No I don't want to argue with him but, it's time that he realizes that nobody believes Larry's coming back anymore.",fru
" Why shouldn't he walk around and dream at him at night.  Walk around.  Why shouldn't he walk around?  Why shouldn't he dream of him, walk around at night waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say flat out that we don't have anymore hope?",ang
 That we haven't had any hope for years now?,ang
 We got to say it to him.,xxx
 Larry's been gone for three years.  For god sakes no one comes back after three years.  It's insane.,fru
" Listen mom, just, sit down.  I want to talk to you.",fru
 Alright. Alright. Alright just listen.,fru
" You know why I asked Annie here, right?",neu
 You know.,xxx
 I want to ask her to marry me.,neu
 You know it's not just my business.,fru
 Okay.  So then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it.,neu
 Oh see then it's just not my business. God you infuriate me sometimes.  Isn't my business too if dad throws a fit?  Huh?  God you have such a talent for ignoring things.,ang
 She's not Larry's girl.,fru
 I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want I have to pull back,fru
 Because other people will suffer.,xxx
" My whole entire, bloody life time and time again.",fru
 Well to hell with that.,ang
 I wanted to get this settled first.,neu
 Then I guess that's the end of it.,neu
 But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.,sad
" And then we'll thrash it out with dad right?  Mom, don't avoid me.",neu
 Well so what?  I'm just not fast with women.,xxx
 Because it is.,fru
 It's just...that's just the way it is.  That's how I feel.  You know these years when I think of someone I want to marry I think of Annie.  What do you want a diagram?,fru
 Alright then.,fru
 I've given it three years of thought and I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.,sad
 But if I can't have that here I'll get out.,neu
 I'll get out.  I'll marry her somewhere else.  Maybe New York.,neu
 I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker and I'm through with it.,ang
 The business doesn't inspire me.,ang
 Yes.  I like it an hour out of the day.  If I have to grub for money all day long at least at evening I want it beautiful.  I want a family.  I want a wife.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to.,ang
 Now Annie is in the middle of all that.  Where do I find it?,fru
 Yes.  On this I would.,neu
 Then help me stay here.,xxx
 I know.  Just you help me stay here.,sad
 I am thinking like that.,sad
 No you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.,sad
 Why did he invite her here?,ang
 Well she's been away for three and a half years in New York and suddenly she just shows up.,ang
 Nobody travels seven hundred miles just see.,xxx
 He's not going to marry her.,xxx
 I see it.  It has the appearance of it.,xxx
 What's going on here Joe?,xxx
 No.  She's not his girl Joe and she knows that.,ang
" Then why is still single?  I mean there's plenty of single men in New York.  Why isn't she married by now?  Probably a hundred men has told her that she's foolish but, she's waiting.",xxx
" Because she knows what I know, that's why.",xxx
" I mean, her faith is stronger than a rock.",ang
" My worst times I think about her, you know, and I",sad
 it's like I know as long as she's waiting I'm right again.,sad
" No.  Nobody in my house better dare and challenge her faith.  You know and maybe strangers but not his father, not his brother.",ang
 I want-I want you to act like he's still alive.  I mean don't think I haven't seen the way that you've been since he invited her here.,xxx
 But I won't have any of this nonsense because you know what happens?  If he doesn't come back I'll kill myself.,xxx
" Laugh, laugh at me but I will.  Because you know what happened when she came here?  When she came back she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Joe, look. Look at it. You got to believe with me.",ang
 I can't do it all alone.,xxx
" Look, it was just last week that Detroit, some boy came back he had been away longer than Larry, you can read it for yourself. You above all people have got to believe.",sad
" Look, just keep believing okay?",xxx
 I can't help it.,sad
 Why does that bother you?,fru
" Well maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her.",neu
 uh-uh What do you mean?  They grew up next to each other their entire lives.  Why shouldn't he want to see her?,fru
 Hey don't look at me like that.  I don't know anymore than you.,fru
 Who said he even thought about that?,neu
" Well, so what?",neu
 Now listen kid...,fru
 You can't read her mind.,xxx
 How do you know why she's waited?  Hmmm?,neu
 Look at how nice the day is.  What are we arguing for?,fru
 What do you want me to do?  What do you want?,fru
 But Kate...,fru
 Okay. Calm yourself. Just calm yourself.,fru
" Calm yourself, alright?",xxx
" Alright, alright, calm yourself okay?  Calm yourself. Wait, wait.  What do you mean, me above all?",ang
" Wait, what does that mean?  Me above all?",ang
" Look at you, you're shaking.",ang
 What do I got to hide?  Huh?  What the hell's the matter with you Kate?,ang
 You're the only one I know that still loves his parents.,xxx
" No.  It's alright.  It's a good thing, you know?",xxx
 It's lovely here.,xxx
 The air is so sweet.,xxx
 No.  I'm not sorry.  But I'm not going to stay.,sad
 First of all your mother so much as told me to go.,xxx
" Look,",sad
" you saw the way that she acted and then well, I mean, you, you were acting kind of...",sad
" Well, I don't know, embarrassed of her since I came.",sad
" Yeah.  I know they would, especially your mother.",xxx
" Well what other reason, from her point of view, would I be coming here?",xxx
" Well,",hap
 I guess that's why I came.,hap
" Look, I've been ready for a long, long time now.",hap
" Look, I almost got married two years ago.",hap
 You started to write me.,hap
 Every day since.,hap
" I was waiting for you Chris, I mean, till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say?",hap
 You'd always be so ambiguous.,hap
 I'll never forgive you for that.,hap
" I mean,  Why did you wait all these years?  There I was sitting around and wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you.",hap
 Not like that you're not.,hap
 Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you Chris.,xxx
 What is it?,xxx
" No, what is it?  Your mother?",xxx
" Tell me what's wrong.  I mean, even in your letters you seemed ashamed.",xxx
 You got to tell me.,xxx
 Okay.  It wouldn't work like this?,xxx
" Yeah, sure.",xxx
 How many?,sad
 Geez.,sad
 And you still feel that way?,sad
 Cause you must not feel that way again.  You hear me?  You can't.  You deserve everything you have Chris.,xxx
" that includes me too, I mean and the money, you have right to that money.  Your father put planes up in the air, good planes and he deserves it, you should be proud of that.  A man should be paid for that.",sad
 What am I going to do with a fortune?,hap
 I know.  It sort of went out of style didn't it?,xxx
 You're not sorry you came?,neu
 Why?,sur
 Well...,xxx
 What?,neu
 Well the trouble is I was planning on sneaking up on you over a week or so and they take it for granted that we're all set.,xxx
 How did you know?,xxx
" So, would you want to?",xxx
" I mean, that's the reason why I asked you here.",hap
 Oh Annie.  I love you.  I love you a great deal.,xxx
 I love you.,hap
 I don't...I have no imagination that's the only way I know how to tell it.,xxx
 I'm embarrassing you.  I didn't want to tell you this here.  I wanted to drive someplace brand new where we'd be brand new to each other.  It feels wrong here don't you?,xxx
" This yard and this chair.  I don't want to win you from anything, I want you to be ready for me.",xxx
" Then he's gone forever, you sure?",xxx
 Why didn't you?,xxx
 You felt something that far back.,hap
 Why didn't you let me know?,xxx
" Give me a kiss Ann, just give me...",hap
" Oh God.  Annie, I kissed Annie.  I kissed Annie.",exc
" How long, how long I've been waiting to do that.",xxx
 We're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.,hap
 I kissed you.,xxx
" Nothing.  Hey, let's drive somewhere.  I want to be alone with you.",sad
" No, nothing, nothing like that.",xxx
" Well, yes I guess I've been ashamed but, it's going from me.",xxx
 I don't know where to start.,xxx
 You remember overseas I was in command of a company?,sad
 Well I lost them.,sad
 Just about all.,sad
 Takes a little while to toss that off cause they weren't just men.,sad
" For instance, one time this...it had been raining several days and this one kid, he came up to me, he gave me his last pair of dry socks, put them in my pocket.",sad
" That's just a little thing but that's the kind of guys I had.  They didn't just die, they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly.",sad
 A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.  And I got this idea watching them go down.  See everything was being destroyed but there was one new thing that was being created.,sad
" It was a kind of responsibility, man for man.  You understand me?",sad
 And to show that and to bring that onto the earth again like some sort of monument standing right behind all of us and we could feel it and it would make a difference to him.,sad
 And then I came here and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was a kind of bus accident.,sad
" And I went to work with dad and that rat race again and I felt what you said, ashamed.  Somehow because nobody was changed at all.",sad
" It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive.  I felt wrong to have that new checkbook,",sad
" open that new bank account, drive the new car and see the new refrigerator",sad
" cause you can take those things out of the war.  But you got to know, when you drive that car that it came out of the love that a man can have for a man and you got to be a little bit better because of that.",sad
 Otherwise what you have is loot and there's blood on it.,sad
 And I didn't want to take any of it and I guess that included you.,sad
 I want you now Annie.,xxx
 [GARBAGE] Annie,xxx
 Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you.,hap
 Buy some hats?,hap
 Fine.,xxx
 What flashlight?,xxx
 It's not your flashlight.,xxx
 It's ours.  Mine too.,xxx
" Well, you keep saying it's my flashlight like it's only your flashlight.  I mean, how do you think that makes me feel?",xxx
 Yes.,neu
" Look, I'm cold.",xxx
" It's past eleven, let's go.",fru
 There is no point in coming down here.,fru
 That's my point.,fru
 So let's go.,xxx
 Not particularly.,xxx
 I don't know.  I just don't.,xxx
" Pass up what?  These fish swim up to shore, on the beach and then they flop around a little, they swim away and then they die.",fru
" What are you getting so excited about?  I mean, it's not like it's like the landing on the moon or something.  I mean, it's just fish, fish that nobody eats.",xxx
 Augie.,fru
 I'm just not.,neu
 Yes.,xxx
" You also could remember that I got sand in my panties, we got in an argument over nothing, you got a sore throat and we didn't even get to see the Grunions.",fru
 You didn't see them the first time either.,fru
 That's the wind.,xxx
 About what?,xxx
 It's ridiculous.,xxx
" Hey, what time is it?  This pokes around midnight right?  God this is great isn't it?",exc
 Look at the night we got.  I wouldn't trade this for anything.,exc
 You know actually I wanted to go a little further up the coast and get away from all the lights and people but I was afraid you'd miss it.  How are you doing?,exc
" Is that, is that, nah, is that just Paul?  I can't even tell.",exc
" But if I can't tell, it probably isn't them isn't it?  Probably would be unmistakable wouldn't you think?  How are you doing?",exc
" Oh, you know what I forgot?  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I should've brought my flashlight.",exc
" You know, the flashlight, the silver one?  There's only one isn't there?",xxx
" Well, whose is it?",xxx
" Well, sure.",xxx
" No.  Of course, our flashlight.  Yours and mine.  Me flashlight is su flashlight, naturally.",xxx
 How could we have not thought to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out.,xxx
 Was it a full moon last year when they were running?  I can't remember.  Do you remember?,xxx
 Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?,xxx
" We should've brought the blanket, our blanket.",xxx
" God.  Oh, you know what would be good right about now?  A six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the ticket.",exc
" I'm so stupid, I should've brought a six-pack.  God, I'm like a little kid.  It's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped up. Oh- [LAUGHTER]",exc
 I wonder if they can hear us talk?  Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?,exc
 Do you want my jacket?,neu
 What?  Are you kidding me?  We just got here.  We miss it.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home?,xxx
 Right.,xxx
 That's my point too...No.  No.  That's not my point.  My point is what's the point if we come down here if we just turn around and leave?,fru
" I mean, don't you want to see it?",xxx
 Why not?,xxx
" Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  It only happens once a year.  I mean think about the people in Kansas, they would have to get hotel reservations and plane tickets to come and see this.  We're only forty minutes away.  This is too good to pass up.",exc
" Well this is like the highlight, the one night of their lives and that flopping around, that's laying eggs or spawning or mating or whatever you call it.",exc
" But this is the big night for these guys.  Their last, life's last orgy.",exc
 Yeah they do.,exc
" Okay.  But it's fish that do something that no other fish do.  Like the swallows in Capistrano or the Lemmings that throw themselves off the cliffs, there's magic here and some mystery and a little bit of unexplainable.",exc
" I mean, I can't see how you can not be interested.",xxx
 For real?,xxx
" I don't get it.  I mean the first time we came to see it, you said it was the best night of your life.",xxx
 And last year when we came you ran out of the house so fast you stubbed your toe and you didn't even notice it until we got in the car.,xxx
 Okay.  We're in a good spot.,xxx
" We just weren't in the good spot.  This is a much better spot.  You know, I have a good instincts for these things.",fru
" Look, is that...no is that just seaweed?",exc
" You know, this is great isn't it?  You know, I wouldn't trade this for anything.",exc
" I mean, think about this, I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute.",exc
" Somewhere out there, there's this huge silver mass of fish heading this way, they don't why, we don't know why, they just some little instinctual fire cracker went off in their bodies...",exc
" ...like and they all just turned at once and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming this way.  They didn't, you know, they didn't make a decision, they didn't, you know, have boats or anything.  No one sent them an invitation or a map, they just started swimming as if that's the only thing that matters.",exc
" It's single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge and they don't, they don't ask it a question, they don't give it a name, they just swim.",exc
 They just start swimming to this place right here where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death.,exc
" Oh, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are standing up.",exc
 [BREATHING] So what do you think?,exc
 About what I just said?,exc
 It certainly is not.  It's,fru
 About what?,ang
 It's ridiculous.,ang
" It's PR.  I mean, somebody sold you a good bill about this wonderful event that going to happen on the beach.",ang
" Yeah.  Everyone else was sold the same thing.  I mean, look, it keeps us excited, it keeps us coming back for more and you know, keeps us thinking life's going to start any minute now.",ang
" Look, I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me.",ang
 It's just...,xxx
" Look, we just have different ideas of what this night is supposed to be like.",xxx
" For heavens sake, grow up.  We're not going to see the Grunions.",fru
" We never do, do we?  Have we ever?",fru
 Okay.  Twice is as many times as we've tried and that's ever.,ang
 What?,xxx
" Augie, god dammit, don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting.",ang
" Look, it's pointless.  It's...we're not going to see the Grunions I mean, it's like waiting around to see Santa Claus, you know, it's...",fru
" Listen, I've waiting my entire life on this beach just standing there waiting for this fish to show up and these fish never show up.",ang
" God, you don't understand anything.",fru
" I do.  I always do.  I keep thinking, this time will be the time and it never is.",fru
" No we won't.  I mean, God, this isn't about the fish Augie.",ang
" Look, do you remember the first time we came here?",fru
 We thought I was pregnant.,sad
 We brought a bottle of champagne and we took off our shoes and danced barefoot in the sand...,xxx
 Under the moon and you whispered so softly into my ear so I could feel your words.,xxx
" And I thought, this is it.  This is how happy I'm supposed to be.",xxx
 What?  Dancing barefoot in the sand?  Drinking out of a bottle of champagne?,xxx
 I'd rather not remember something...,sad
 Rather not hope for something.,sad
 No.,sad
 No.,fru
 No.,fru
 No.,fru
 No...No...No...,fru
 No...,fru
 I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be.,ang
" This what...what's this?  This isn't anything. Alright.  Sure.  Standing on the beach, fighting and waiting.",fru
 Cause everything isn't anything like I thought it would be.,ang
 This is just this.  You know?  I mean it's a lot and everything but it isn't somewhere else.  Do you know what I'm trying to say?,sad
 I know you are Augie.  I know you wanted this evening to be nice.,sad
 I can't help thinking about being somewhere else.,sad
 I didn't say that.,sad
" Augie, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing with you.",sad
 Yeah.  Don't you know that?,xxx
 If anybody wants to be with anybody else it's probably you.  Probably somebody who enjoys herself a little more and is not so hard.,sad
" Well, I guess this is the wrong spot for the right people.",sad
 Yeah.  I noticed that.  It's real pretty on the water.,hap
 Big old white moon.,xxx
 Oh you brought refreshments.,hap
 Well at least we won't need glasses.,xxx
 No I'm beginning to think you might be right.,hap
 I think this may be the place for us after all.,hap
 I am sorry Augie.,hap
 Or not.,hap
 So what do you think?,exc
 About what I just said?,fru
 It certainly is not.  It's a slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,fru
 I'm not the only one.  Look at all these people.,fru
 Are we talking about the same thing?,fru
 I thought you wanted to see it.,fru
" There's nothing to it.  The Grunions arrive, they do their little fish business, you know?  We go oh, ahh, look at the fish and they go home and we go home.",fru
 Why not?,fru
" Oh my gosh.  We missed them twice, that's hardly ever.",fru
" Carla, can I ask you something?",fru
" Don't take this wrong but, are you having your period?",fru
 What's bugging you then?,fru
 I thought you wanted to see it.,fru
" No, of course not.",fru
" Well, we're going to see it.",neu
" What...I've been trying to, I've been trying to figure out the point where we went wrong and I can't seem to pinpoint that moment.",fru
" You were fine during the phone call with Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was no problem.",xxx
" Let's see I took a shower, you were watching the news, you said hey, hey the Grunions are running tonight and I said great let's go, I feel lucky tonight.",neu
" And then I'm putting the animals out in the yard, I'm pulling the car out of the garage, putting my jacket on.",fru
 Wait a minute.  I've got it.,neu
 It was in the car right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker...,neu
 And you said let's get some champagne and I said time's a wasting or something like that.,neu
 You want this to be like the other time right?  That's it right?,neu
" Okay, right.  I got it.  Sure.  Of course.  Listen, do you want to dance?",xxx
 Do you want me to get some champagne?,fru
 Take off our shoes?,fru
 What?  Do you want me to breathe in your ear?,fru
 Do you want to get married again? What? What?  Do you want a divorce? A vacation? What?  A carpet?  A poodle?  A basket of fruit?  What?  A suicide pact?  What the hell do you want Carla?,xxx
 Welcome to the human race.,ang
 Do you think that this is what I had in mind?  That four years down the line that we'd get married and come to the beach and argue with each other over fish?  No.,ang
 I was just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great and the sand in our toes and the wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'd have three big fat rosy kids...,ang
 ...and you know?  Baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get?  Do you know what you get Carla?  You get this.,ang
 Yes it is.,ang
 Right.,ang
 No.  I know.  Me neither.,xxx
 I'm trying to do the best I can.,fru
 Maybe if you were with someone else too.,sad
 I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.,sad
 Yeah?,xxx
" Actually, now that you mention it, no I don't.",xxx
 It seemed like a good spot to me.,xxx
 I mean look at the view of the moon we got from here.,hap
" Hey, look what we got here.",hap
 It's not champagne.,xxx
 Are you still cold?  Do you want to go home?,xxx
 Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come.,hap
 Or not.,hap
 Do you think it's them?,xxx
 And nobody knows we're here except for Freda and she wouldn't ring up.,xxx
 What are you going to do?,xxx
 Now and always sweet.,exc
" I mean, it was, it's bound to come out sooner or later.",exc
 That sent shivers up my spine.,exc
 Behave exquisitely.,exc
 Certainly.  And I shall probably do a court courtesy.,xxx
 What is so horrible is that one cannot stay happy.,xxx
" It's true.  I mean, the whole business it's a very poor joke.",xxx
 Yes.  I mean just that.,xxx
 Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.,xxx
 Who's they?,xxx
 So if I'm to laugh at everything then I must laugh at us too.,xxx
 How long will it last?  This ludicrous overbearing love of ours?,xxx
 Shall we always want to bicker and fight?,xxx
" Well, dear, shall we want that?",xxx
" What happens if one of us dies?  I mean, does the other one still laugh?",xxx
 That's serious enough.,sad
 Darling I believe you're talking nonsense.,xxx
" Elliot, worms don't pop.",xxx
 Thank you dear.  The same applies to you...,xxx
 ...only if you ever so much as look at another woman I'll kill you.,xxx
 Which particular one?,xxx
" Charles, that was his name, Charles.  Oh, God he was so wiggled so beautifully.",xxx
 Yeah.  I know you did.  You threw it out the window and into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.,xxx
 It went on intermittently for days.,xxx
 I burnt a hole in my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.,xxx
 [LAUGHTER] Yeah.  That was the first time you ever hit me.,xxx
" The manager came in and saw us rolling on the floor, scratching and biting like panthers.",xxx
" How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.",xxx
 And much sillier too.,xxx
 Good God.,xxx
 I wonder.,xxx
 Well it must be them then.,xxx
 We're fine right?  Aren't we?  Whatever happens darling.,xxx
 I don't care then.,exc
 Hello?  Hello?  What?,xxx
" No, wrong number.",exc
 What are we to do if they suddenly walk in on us?,xxx
 With the most perfect poise?,xxx
 um- Things that should matter dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy do they?,xxx
" Oh, darling.  Don't say that.",xxx
" You mean that, that sacred and beautiful thing love?",xxx
 What does that all mean?  That's what I asked myself on my quest for ultimate truth.  What does it all mean?,xxx
" [LAUGHTER] Oh, darling.  You mustn't be serious, that's just what they want.",xxx
 All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.,xxx
 Laugh at all their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings the acid in their damn sweetness and light.,xxx
" Oh, certainly, you must.  We're figures of fun alright.",xxx
 Who knows?,xxx
 No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.,xxx
" Well, it depends on how well we've played.",xxx
" Of course, yes, yes, with all his might.",xxx
" No.  No it isn't.  That's very laughable, a cunning little mystery all done with mirrors.",xxx
" Oh, and who isn't talking nonsense?",xxx
 Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers hmmm?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and party as much as we can like quite idiotic school children.,xxx
 Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come kiss me darling before worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.,xxx
" I don't care what you do, you see?  As long, no I don't care what you do, see?",xxx
 You can put green paint all over your body and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best.,xxx
 Remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,xxx
 The one when you bought a little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it in my bed.,xxx
 Horrible little thing.,xxx
 I hated it.,xxx
 How long did that rile last?,xxx
" Oh, the worst one was in Cannes when you-",xxx
 you're curling iron burnt a hole in my dressing gown.,xxx
 That was a rouser wasn't it?,xxx
 I didn't hit you very hard.,neu
 I will never forget his face. Ooh-rah [LAUGHTER].,xxx
 We were very much younger then.,xxx
 The real cause of that rile was Peter Burden.,xxx
" Oh, come on, you knew there was nothing in that.",neu
 Presents?  A trivial little broach.,ang
 Not at all.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often.,xxx
 No I didn't.  You made up the whole thing in your jealous imagination.,neu
 Just a little perhaps but nothing serious.,neu
 Well what of it?,xxx
" Well it didn't harm him, in fact, it pleasured him a lot and it didn't hurt me.",neu
" Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey you would've never known anything.",xxx
" Look, I'm bored with this conversation.",xxx
 No thanks.,xxx
 I don't know why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.,ang
 I don't see what you have to go on and on with this kind of thing.,ang
 It's become a habit with you.,neu
 Don't be so stupid.,xxx
 What?,ang
 [BREATHING],xxx
" No, just making myself beautiful for you.",neu
 That's the woman's job to lure the man.  Watch me a moment won't you?,neu
 No it isn't.,xxx
" Oh, be quiet.",xxx
 I think you should have some more brandy...,xxx
 ...cause really,xxx
 it doesn't seem to be working on you.,xxx
 Well it really hasn't worked wonders with you.,xxx
" Adders don't snap, they sting.",ang
 They sting.,ang
 I don't care.  I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care if they roll around and bark like hoops.,xxx
" Yes, I did.  Quite a lot.",xxx
 Mind your business.,ang
 You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk.,ang
 You've always had a weak head.,ang
" On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk off just one glass of brandy.",ang
 Shut up.,ang
" Not very funny dear.  In fact, maybe you better have some more brandy.",ang
 Why?,xxx
 There aren't any people upstairs.  This is a photographer's studio.,xxx
 They are away in Tunis.,neu
" Turn it on again, please.",fru
 Very well.  If you insist on being a boorish and idiotic.,ang
 You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.,ang
 Go away.  Go away.  I hate you.,ang
" I hate you.  Listen I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.",ang
" This is the end.  Understand?  This is the end, here and now, forever and always.",ang
" Oh, yes I am. Yes I am and you can't stop me.",ang
" Listen, you're a cruel fiend and I hate, loathe you.  Thank God finally, finally thank God I've realized just how horrible you are--and marry you?  Marry you?  Never. I will never marry you.  I will die die in torment-",ang
 Beast. Brute. Cad. Swine. Beast. Beast. Brute. Devil. Sorry.,ang
 Yes.  The real cause of that rile was Peter Burden.,neu
 I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.,xxx
 Mmm Hmm.  I remember it well.  Bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.,xxx
 You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,ang
 You must admit he was in love with you.,ang
 You let him kiss you. You said so.  What of it?,ang
 And what about me?,ang
" Oh, that's a nice point of view I must say.",ang
" Yeah, so am I.  Bored stiff.",ang
 You want some brandy?,neu
 I'll have a little I think.,neu
 No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones.,ang
 Oh my...just because I just...okay...,ang
 ...having three small minute liquor glasses in the evening is hardly going on and on and on.,xxx
 You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.,ang
 Really Amanda.,fru
 Nothing.,fru
 Going out somewhere dear?,fru
 That reply has broken my heart.,xxx
 Actually that's perfectly true.,neu
 Yes it is.,neu
 I think that,neu
" perhaps maybe you should've had more brandy, it might've made you a little less disagreeable.",xxx
" Hmm, snap, snap, snap like a little adder.",xxx
 Yes they do.  They have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.,xxx
 They snap.,fru
 Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,xxx
 I suppose you let him kiss you a great deal more then?,xxx
" Mmm, you must've had a riotous time.  No restraint at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyhow.",xxx
 I'm not in the least bit drunk.,ang
" Okay, like I mentioned before I had three very small, minute liquor glasses of brandy.  That's not even enough to get a child of two drunk.",ang
" Oh, what an interesting topic.  What about a child of four and a child of six?  A child of nine?",ang
 We might be able to bring up a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots.,ang
" Oh, thanks.  I think I will.",ang
 You better turn that off.,ang
 Because people upstairs will get annoyed.,xxx
 Well there are people downstairs I suppose.,xxx
" Oh, this is no time to be in here for Tunis.",xxx
 No I'll do no such thing.,ang
" Come on, turn it off.  It's driving me mad.",ang
 Turn it--Turn it off.,ang
 Very amusing indeed.,ang
" You know what?  You're a vile, little, evil-minded, little, wicked beast and I never want to see you again.",ang
 You're not going nowhere. No you're not.,ang
 Just shut up.,ang
 shut up. shut up.  I would-I would never marry you again if you came crawling back to me on your hands and knees because you're an evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never see you again.,ang
 Oh.,ang
" Hi.  Um, excuse me I've been to, like, five of the desks here and nobody seems to be able to tell me what it is I need to do.  I've been here for over an hour.  Can you possibly help me?",xxx
 Well I filled out all the forms and I've given them to everyone and they keep sending me to someone else.,fru
 Yes.  I'm just trying to get a new license.,fru
 Okay.  I did-,fru
 I did exactly what they told me to do.,ang
 I have done everything everyone in this entire place has told me to do.  I've been here for over an hour.  They make me wait in line.  Every single time I start over again.,fru
 I have a life.  I have things to do.  I have places to go.  Can you not just put this through please?,fru
" Okay, that's nice. That's nice but I have done everything you people have told me to do. I don't understand why you can't just help me get this done.  It's simple, right?  License.  I need it. Can we just do this please?",fru
 I've been to the back of the line five times.,ang
 Okay.  What is it that I did wrong on the form that I have to start all over again?,ang
" Okay.  Well, I can do that right here right now without going to the back of the line again.  See look initialed.  All done. Ready to go.",ang
 I have been waiting for over an hour.,fru
 I'm not starting over again.  No I have done this five times.  I am not starting over again.,ang
 Look can you not just help me?,fru
 I mean look she's -she's perfectly nice.  She doesn't mind waiting for a couple of minutes because I've been here all day. I have a job to get back to.  I have kids to pick up from school.  I can't just stay here.,ang
 No.  No.  No. No. You have to help me.,xxx
 This is your job is to help people like me who need to get a new license.,ang
 That's like the whole purpose of you being here.,xxx
 I- I- I'm testing your patience?,xxx
 I'm testing your patience?,ang
 Yeah.  You have to be here all day.,xxx
 I don't need to be.  I need to go and do other things with my time.  Okay.,ang
" Please just put the form in, take the picture, let me get my license and get the hell out of here.  Please.",ang
" Uh, lets- What do you need exactly?",fru
" You need a new license, is that what you're telling me?",fru
 Let me see the form. Just let me see the form. Yeah.  You filled this out wrong.  I can't - I can't - I can't do anything with this.,fru
 Ma'am I cannot help you.  You need to fill out a new form and you need to get in the back of the line.,fru
 Ma'am I can't help you.  Do you understand?,fru
 I've got a life too ma'am,ang
 and I got to - i got to work here all day long.  Okay.  I've got to deal with you people all day.,fru
 So what I need you to do is I need you to fill out this form correctly and go to the back of the line.,fru
 There's nothing I can do for you.  Do you understand that?  Nothing.,ang
" What I need you to do is go to the back of the line,",fru
 fill out this form and wait,fru
 You're going to have to go back again.,ang
 This whole area here you didn't initial,xxx
 and you filled out-,fru
 Ma'am I have other people waiting in line right now.  I have other people waiting in line right now.,ang
 This whole area of the form was not supposed to be filled out and you put the address in the wrong place,fru
" Uhh, and you spelled your own name wrong.  So I need you to take that",fru
" and, uh, throw it away. I need you to fill out a new form.",fru
 Ma'am you're going to have- you- look. You really- you really,fru
 I can't help you right now.  Do you understand that?,xxx
 Look I'm going on my lunch break right now.  So you're just going to have to take this form and go to the back of the line.,xxx
 like I said before right now.,ang
 Ma'am you are testing my patience.  Do you understand me?,fru
 You're testing my goddamn patience.,ang
" I work in this fucking building all day. And I'm sick of it, okay?",ang
 I've walked away already.  I'm not here anymore.,xxx
 Yeah.  They just called.,sad
 I know.,sad
 I don't know what to say.  I don't want to go but I don't have a lot of choice.,sad
 I'm going to come back.  I need you to believe that.,sad
 I need you to believe that too.  How am I supposed to believe everything's going to be okay if you don't?,xxx
 Well you have to have faith because I don't have a choice and I have to go.,sad
 Do you think I want to leave you?,sad
 I have to do this.  I don't want to leave.  Do you think I want to miss seeing her grow up?,sad
 Look we both knew what this meant when I signed on,fru
 And now- and now it's really shitty timing but now I have to go.,sad
 I mean I'm the one who has to leave here.  I'm the one who has to leave the two of you.  At least you get to be together.,fru
 What's that supposed to mean?,sad
 Well I'll come back.  What is that supposed to mean?  You're not willing to wait for me to come back?,ang
 What do you want me to do?,fru
 Well I can't very well do it today.  I still have to leave tomorrow.,fru
" You're not making this any easier for me, you know.  I'm the one who has to go and you're really not helping.",fru
 I do have to go. And I need to know that you're here waiting for me and that you believe that I'm coming back.,fru
 Thanks that helps.,ang
 I feel much better now.,ang
 I know I'm leaving you here with all the responsibility but at least you get to be with her.,fru
 I will but I can't right now.,fru
 You know- you know how this works.  I have to go.,xxx
 That's how you want to leave it?,ang
 I want you to be okay with it as much as you can be.  I mean it's not a great situation but we don't have an option here.,sad
 Fine.,sad
 So you're leaving tomorrow.,sad
 This is really-this is unfair.,sad
 I don't see [BREATHING],fru
" I mean we both knew that this was going to happen.  It's just that I feel that, you know, I don't want Susie growing up without a mother.",fru
" And, uh, I'm afraid that if you, you know, when you leave, you won't come back.",sad
 You don't know that.,fru
" I'll believe it, but- I'll believe it but it- I don't know that that's going to happen.",fru
 You do have a choice.  You don't have to go.,xxx
 You have a choice.,fru
 I know.  It's just you don't have to do this for a living you know.,fru
 You're a smart person.  There are other things you can do.,fru
 It's just not going to work out without you here.,xxx
 I mean we can't-we're not a complete family without you here.,sad
 Of course I'm going to wait.  I just- I just don't like the idea of this happening because this isn't the last time this is going to happen. You're going to go on more tours and stuff.  I just- I can't-,fru
 I can't deal with this emotionally.,fru
 I want you to leave.  I want you to leave the service.,fru
 You can do it today.  You don't have to do anything.  You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.,fru
 Look I'm just telling you that you don't have to go.,fru
 That's all I'm saying... No you don't.,ang
 It's just really unfair.  This is- this is bullshit.,fru
" You're acting like, you know, you're the one who's going all through, you know, all this shit and it's really- it's really not.",ang
 Yeah.  Of course I do because I didn't enlist in this stupid thing.  Why don't you just get out now and then-,ang
 Yes- You don't have to go.  What are they going to do?  Huh?  Put a gun to your head?,xxx
 Then go.  We'll be here when you get back.,fru
" I don't know how else to leave it.  What, do you want me to lie to you?",sad
 You want me tell you that I'm okay with it?,sad
 Well I can't be okay with it the same way you can't not go.  It just doesn't work that way.,sad
 I have something to tell you.,exc
 It's really exciting.  Don't you want to guess?,exc
 Look.,exc
 Yes.  He finally proposed.  I'm getting married.,exc
 I know. I'm so-,exc
 Thank you. [LAUGHTER],exc
 You think. [LAUGHTER],exc
" Well actually we were just talking about today and I don't really want to do like the traditional church thing, you know.  So we are going to get married in the meadow.",exc
 Do you remember up by Yosemite? Yeah.,xxx
 We're going to get married in the middle of a meadow. [LAUGHTER],exc
" Everybody's going to come up. We're going to stay in all the pretty cabins up there and, um, everybody's going to have, you know, really flowery sort of naturey stuff.",hap
 So pretty.,exc
 Very Midsummer Night's wedding.,hap
 Thanks. Thanks a lot.  You're really helping the Excitement here. I hope no one dies.,exc
" Okey Well- well-, you know what?  I was hoping that you would help",exc
 plan everything.  So then you can make sure that no one gets attacked by bears.,exc
 Yeah?,exc
 Really?,exc
" Okay.  It's going to be in, like, six months.  So we don't have a really long time.",exc
 Okay.,xxx
 No.  No browns.,xxx
 It's a wedding.,xxx
 Blue for the sky.,xxx
 Come on.,xxx
 who- Who's getting married though?,xxx
 to help plan because I'm getting married. [LAUGHTER],xxx
 No.,xxx
 It's not your wedding. You can-,xxx
 You know what? You know what?,xxx
" You can't ruin my mood today.  If you want to wear a brown tux, you go ahead and wear a brown tux",xxx
 but bridesmaids aren't wearing brown and I'm not wearing brown.,xxx
 Maybe,xxx
 I like blue.,xxx
 That would work.,xxx
" Throw in a little- little, uh, trim in yellow.  Maybe some yellow flowers.",exc
" Yeah.  I hadn't actually thought about the cake yet, but",xxx
 Yes.,exc
 See this is why you have to help.,xxx
 because you're going to take care of everything.  You're going to think of all the details that I forget.,exc
 Well right but you can help.,xxx
 Ha ha ha.,exc
 Ha ha.,exc
 Just couldn't be any cooler.,exc
 I know.  I've been waiting forever.  I can't believe it's finally happening.,exc
 You don't look like you're going to faint.,exc
 So- So when are you getting married Mr. Excited?,exc
 What about Kathy?  I mean you guys have been dating for a while.,xxx
 You haven't ruined it yet.,exc
 You really like,exc
 What?  She could be just as excited as I am right now.,xxx
 You could make her that excited.  You really like her.  You guys have been together for a really long time now.,exc
 [LAUGHTER] That's more than I needed to know.,exc
 [laughter],exc
 What?  You seem so excited.,neu
" Uh, you got a new car, a new house. Uh, a dog.",neu
 Are you serious?  You're getting married.,sur
 Holy shit that's amazing.,exc
 Congratulations.,exc
" I'm invited, right.",exc
" I'll have to, uh, I'll have to get myself a new tux.  My, uh, the old one is a little worn and dirty.  That's awesome.  Where are you guys going to have it?",xxx
" Well, that's- that's- that's beautiful. That's a beautiful place to do it.",xxx
 That's great,xxx
 I hope- they're not like,xxx
" Right.  Nice.  That's great.  I hope while we're up there nobody gets attacked by any, like, bears or wolves or anything.",xxx
" Well no, I am- I'm trying to be positive",xxx
 I'm trying to be positive.  I'm trying to say I hope that doesn't happen.,xxx
 We're going to be in the middle of the wilderness. These kind of things happen,xxx
 Yeah.  I'll help plan.,exc
 Yeah.,xxx
 Sure.,xxx
" I'm thinking greens, lots of greens. Greens and browns.  We're nature.",xxx
 Why not browns?,neu
" It's a light brown, tanish.",neu
 I just think browns are really what you want to go with.  I mean I think there's more contrast between brown and green than there is-,neu
 I know but you just asked me to-,neu
 So we're going to go greens and browns.,xxx
" Come on.  Please will you do the greens and browns, just the browns for me?",fru
 Just for me.  Come on.  I'm your best friend.,xxx
 I'm your best friend,xxx
 Give me the browns.,xxx
 Okay.  Fine.  So green and what?,neu
 Blue?,neu
" Okay, fine. Greens and blues.",neu
 Greens and blues and maybe a little light yellow?,neu
 Yeah?,neu
" Okay.  That sounds good. Um, and, uh, we're going to get like a five, uh, story cake, right?",neu
" I mean, you know, you're going to have at least, like, two hundred and fifty people come.  So we're going to need, you know, just a huge buffet.",neu
" Fried chicken, mashed potatoes.",neu
 Well I can't be in charge of this.  I mean I got things I got to do.,neu
 Well this is really exciting.  I mean- I just- I couldn't be happier right now.,exc
 I'm thrilled.  God.,exc
 Just ecstatic.  I can't believe you're my best friend,exc
" You're my best friend, we're growing up and now you're getting married. that's amazing",exc
 Wow.  I just- I- I- I feel like I'm going to faint.,exc
 I'm so- all the blood,exc
" has just rushed to my head, and I, and I mean honestly.",exc
 I'm getting a little weak in the knees.,exc
" You know that I've never-I- I have a long run of bad relationships but, you know, I mean, you got to work through it.  It's fine.",xxx
" Yeah, but",xxx
" Yeah.  I know but it's, you know, maybe we'll get married.  I don't know.  Should be pretty-",xxx
" I don't know.  Okay.  I mean gosh.  There's just- look there's a lot of pressure in getting married, okay.",neu
" Oh, I've made her that excited.",xxx
 What?  You've heard me talk about it before.,xxx
 I'm a monster in bed.,xxx
 That's helpful.,neu
 I just don't think I can do this anymore.  It's been a really long time and it's not like I'm not trying.,fru
 I am try-  it's been three years,fru
 and I have gone everywhere I can think of.  I have given resumes.  I have done interviews.  I've tried to pull in favors.  I've asked everybody I know for help.  I don't know what else to do.,fru
" Okay but I've been trying for three years.  Three years and I haven't gotten a bite much less actually gotten hired, and I am smart enough.  Thank you very much.",fru
 I'm really good at what I do.  I just don't know how to make someone else see that.,ang
 What?  Who says that?  Bananas don't grow overnight.,ang
 Okay.  I think three years is a little excessive.,fru

" Okay. Okay, Fine.",ang
 Okey So I'm doing something wrong.  What am I doing wrong?,ang

 Well I mean I need to make a little bit more than the minimum wage fry flipper.,fru
 I did start somewhere.  I worked my way up.  I'm not going to start at the bottom again.,fru
 What's my problem?  What's my problem? I don't have a job.,ang
 I thought I was pretty clear about what the problem was.,ang
 Well maybe you could be a little helpful.  I mean obviously you don't have any problems so would it really take so much time out of your day to just go ahead and help somebody else.,fru
 That's important.  That's really important.,fru
 Hey.  Get out of the way.  I'm watching TV.,xxx

 You guys lost my bag.,fru
 Yeah.  Yeah I did.,fru
" I-I don't know.  The place where they told me to go.  Look they told me to come talk to you because you guys lost my bag.  Not it's late.  Not it will be here soon, lost it completely.  What are you going to do about that?",fru
 Look that bag has my entire life in it and you just lost it.,fru
" Lost it just, like, I mean,",ang
 it's not like it just disappeared into thin air. Somebody wasn't paying attention,ang
" because my bag was very easy to keep track of.  It's got big, you know, rainbow colored crap all over it and no one was paying attention because now it's just gone.",ang
 Wait.  What?,sur
 No. No. I heard- I heard what you said.,ang
" You're kidding me, right.  You're going to give me fifty dollars to completely cover my bag, everything that was in it, the inconvenience that I've gone through.  I paid for my ticket.  All I expect is to safely get to my destination with my stuff.  Is that so much to ask?  I mean I really don't think that's that big a deal to ask you guys to have my bag in the place where I leave and then put my bag where I end up.",ang
" Yeah, well that's got everything I have in it.",ang
 Look fifty dollars is unacceptable.  My bag itself cost over a hundred and fifty dollars.  You can't just give me fifty dollar gift certificate to Percoes or whatever the hell and then send me off like that's- that's good enough.  Like that's all I needed was fifty dollars.  My bag is worth more than that.,ang
 I expect your airline who was responsible for my bag to give me the equivalent of the bag and all of the things in it.,ang
 I didn't sign anything. I didn't sign anything. And you people have got to make-,ang
 You have to make amends for what you did for losing my bag and all of my stuff.  Fifty dollars is unacceptable.,ang
 No.  No.  I don't know. You know what? I'm going to call my lawyer. You know what?  That's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to call my lawyer and have him get down here and explain to you that this is an unacceptable option.,ang
 I want to talk to your supervisor.,ang
" I've had enough.  I want to talk to-no, no unacceptable I want to your supervisor. I am done with this.",ang
" Really, you don't work for anybody.  It's just you?",ang
" Okay.  Well I want to call whoever you report to, whoever your boss is because I have had enough with this airline and I am finished waiting for my fifty dollar gift certificate.",ang

 If you'd like to take that over to the front desk- Ma'am.,fru
 We're just talking over each other.,fru
 We're not going to communicate anything this way.,fru

 I am the current manager on duty.,fru

" I just- I just thought he would have longer, you know, because I'm- I mean when he found out he was sick, we knew that wasn't good but I just- I just thought that it would take longer, you know?",sad
 Yeah. I know. I know.,sad
" Yeah, I know. But I'd rather have him here with me, you know. It's just not fair.  I mean he- he didn't get to do like anything. I mean he was-",sad
" He was only twenty four and just so many things that we were going to do, you know, and now he won't get to do them and he won't get to be here when I do.  You know, like I'll get married some day and he won't be there, like, he won't get to see that.",sad
 It just doesn't seem fair.,sad
 Thank you for being here.,sad
 [LAUGHTER] You're probably right.  He probably would be pissed if we were all sitting around being upset about it. He'd want us to have a party.,hap
 And to drink in his honor. [LAUGHTER],hap
" Yeah, I know.",sad
" Hey, I'm, uh. I'm really sorry about what happened.  I don't um- I mean what you can you do?  I mean it's-",sad
" When I was seven, my- my grandmother died and I really- I don't know, I mean it was really hard to let go but the important thing is- is that you do let go and your realize that, you know, they- you know, they- this person had fun while they were- while they were here and, uh, you know, you work- you work through it.",sad
 Mmhmm. Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean it's- it's hard.  It's hard.,sad
 Yeah.,sad
" Well I mean, you know, I mean it was I mean with that kind of condition,",neu
" you know, it's inevitable  and I mean honestly it's- it's almost like",sad
" you know, you don't- you know, how long do you want the person to go through that, you know.",neu
 It's sort of- it's almost better off to rest in peace than he is to live in pain.,neu
 Yeah.,sad
" It's not fair but I mean that's, you know, the course of life is that, you know, you meet people and you lose them.",sad
 You're okay,sad
 You know I think- I think we should celebrate because I think that's what he would have wanted.,sad
 Yeah.,neu
" That's right.  That's right.  I mean he would want us to, you know, celebrate the life that he- that he lived and, you know, enjoy the rest of ours as much as we can.",sad
 So-,sad

 okay.  Well I'm not going to be undecided forever. [LAUGHTER],exc
 And it's so close so you can come visit me all the time.,exc

 How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does.,fru
 The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.,fru
 I don't see why it has to be Annie.,ang
 Well that's a good answer but it don't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went to war.  It's been five years.,ang
" I don't want a diagram.  He thinks he's coming back, Chris.",fru
 You marry that girl.  You're pronouncing him dead.  Now what happens to your father?  Do you know because I don't?,ang
 Just give it some more thought.,xxx
 What the hell is this?,xxx
 Are you crazy?,ang
 You've got a business here.  What the hell is this?,ang
 Must you be inspired?,ang
 You mean-tell me something you mean you'd really leave the business?,fru
 Well you don't want to think that way.,xxx
 Alright but don't think that way,ang
" because what the hell did we work for?  This whole shooting match is just for you, Chris.",ang
 But don't think that way.  You hear me?,ang
 I don't understand you do I?,xxx
 Yeah.  I can see that.,ang
 He saw it.,neu
 He was out here when it broke.,xxx
 About four this morning.  I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right there when it cracked.,xxx
" I don't know.  When it cracked, he ran back into the house and cried in the kitchen.",xxx
" No, I figured the best thing was to leave him alone.",sad
 I could hear him right through the floor of my room.,sad
 I guess he is.,xxx
" I don't know the meaning of this, mom.  But I know one thing you made a terrible mistake with dad.",fru
" Being dishonest with him, that kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.",fru
 You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,ang
 I don't want to argue with him but it's time that he realizes that Larry's not coming back anymore.,ang
" Why shouldn't he dream of him?  Walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we have no hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now?",xxx
 We've got to say it to him.,ang
 For God's sake three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.,ang
 Sit down mom.  I want to talk to you.,fru
" Alright, alright, alright.  Listen. You know why I asked Annie here don't you?",fru
 You know why.,neu
 I'm going to ask her to marry me.,neu
 You know it's not only my business.,fru
 Then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it.,fru
 Then it isn't just my business.,ang
 Sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?  Isn't it your business too if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it.,ang
 Sometimes you have a- Sometimes you have a talent for ignoring things.,ang
 She's not Larry's girl.,fru
" I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole bloody life time after time after time.",fru
 To hell with that.,ang
 I wanted to get this settled first.,sad
" Well if she does, then that's the end of it.  From her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.",fru
" and then we'll thrash it out with dad, right mom.  Don't avoid me.",ang
 So what I'm not fast with women.,ang
 Because it is.,ang
 I can't help it.  I know her best.  I was brought up next door to her.,xxx
" These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?",sad
 Alright then mom.,xxx
" I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I waited, dad would forget about Larry",ang
" and everything would be happy and we would have a regular wedding.  But if that can't happen here, then I'll have to get out.",fru
" I'll get out.  I'll get married and live someplace else, maybe New York.",xxx
 I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker I'm through with it.,xxx
" The business, the business doesn't inspire me.",ang
" Yes, I like it an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening I want it beautiful.",fru
 I want- I want a family.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I give myself to.  Annie is in the middle of that.  Now where do I find it?,fru
 Yes on this I would.,xxx
 Then you help me stay here.,fru
 I know.  Just you help me stay here.,fru
 I am thinking that way.,xxx
 No.  I'm a pretty tough guy.,xxx
 Why did he invite her?,ang
 It's been three years.  Why all of a sudden?,ang
 Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,fru
 She's not going to marry him.,xxx
 It's got that about it.,xxx
" What's going on here, Joe?",ang
" No, line.",ang
" She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.",ang
 Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men.  Why hasn't she married?,ang
 Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish but she's waited.,ang
 Because she knows what I know that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.,ang
" In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.",fru
" Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might but not his father, not his brother.",fru
" I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since he invited her.  I won't stand for any nonsense.",xxx
" Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.",fru
" Laugh, laugh at me, but why did that happen the very night she came back?",xxx
" She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look, look at it.  Joe-",ang
" Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand alone.",fru
 Just last week a man showed up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  You read it yourself.,fru
 You above all have got to believe.  You.,fru
 Just don't stop believing.,fru
 I can't help it.,fru
 Why does that bother you?,neu
 Well maybe- maybe he just wanted to see her again.,neu
 What do you mean?  He was brought up next door to the girl his whole life.  Why shouldn't he want to see her again?,xxx
 Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anymore than he told you.,xxx
 How do you know he's even thinking about it?,neu
 Well so what.,xxx
 Listen kid.,fru
" Uh, Then why is she still-she's not his girl, Joe",neu
 You can't read her mind.,neu
 How do you know why she waited?,fru
 Look it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for?,fru
 What do you want me to do?,fru
 But Kate-,fru
 Calm yourself.,fru
 Calm yourself.,fru
 Alright.  Alright.  Calm yourself.,fru
 Why me above all?,fru
" What does that mean, me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking.",ang
 What have I got to hide?  What the hell is matter with you Kate?,fru
 You're the only one I know who loves his parents.,xxx
 It's okay.  It's a good thing.,xxx
 You know it's lovely here.  The air is sweet.,xxx
" Not sorry, no but I'm not staying.",xxx
" In the first place, your mother as much as told me to go.",xxx
 You saw that and you- you've been kind of-,xxx
 Well kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.,xxx
" I knew they would, your mother anyway.",xxx
 From her point of view why else would I come?,xxx
 I guess this is why I came.,hap
" Chris, I've been ready a long, long time.",hap
 I almost got married two years ago.,xxx
 You started to write me.,hap
 Every day since.,hap
" I was waiting for you, Chris.  Till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say.  I mean you sure can be ambiguous you know.",hap
 I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I've done is sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.,hap
 Not like that you're not.,xxx
" Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.",xxx
 What is it Chris?,xxx
" No.  What is it Chris, your mother?",xxx
 Well then what's wrong?  Even in your letters there was something ashamed.,xxx
 You've got to tell me.,xxx
 It wouldn't work this way.,xxx
" Yeah, sure.",neu
 How many?,sad
" Oh, gees.",xxx
 And do you still feel that way?,xxx
" Because you mustn't feel that way anymore because you have a right to whatever you have, Chris, do you understand, everything",xxx
 that includes me.  And your money there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air.,xxx
 You should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.,xxx
 What'll I do with a fortune?,hap
 I know it went out of style didn't it?,xxx
 You're not sorry you came.,xxx
 Why?,xxx
 Well.,xxx
 What?,ang
 The trouble is I planned on sneaking up on you over a period of a week or so but they take it for granted that we're all set.,xxx
 How did you know?,xxx
 Wouldn't you want to?,xxx
 I guess you know this is why I asked you to come.,neu
" Ann, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you.",hap
 I have no imagination that's all I know to tell you.,hap
 I'm embarrassing you.  I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I,hap
" wanted some place we'd never been, a place where we'd be brand new to each other.",xxx
" You think this is wrong, this chair, this yard.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to win you away from anything.",xxx
 And he's gone forever.  You're sure?,neu
 Why didn't you?,xxx
 You felt something that far back?,xxx
" Ann, why didn't you let me know?",xxx
" Give me a kiss, Ann.  Give me a-God I kissed you.",hap
" I kissed Annie.  How long, how long I've been waiting to kiss you.",hap
" Annie, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.",hap
 I kissed you.,xxx
 Let's drive some place.  I want to be alone with you.,xxx
" No, nothing like that.",sad
 Yes.  I suppose I have been but it's going from me.,sad
 I don't know where to start.,fru
 There's so many things mixed up.,sad
 You remember overseas I was in command of a company?,sad
 Well I lost them.,sad
 Just about all.,sad
 It takes a lot of time to toss that off because they weren't just men.,sad
" For instance, one time it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.",sad
 I put them in my pocket. that's only a little thing but these are the kind of guys I had.,sad
 They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.,sad
" And I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed see, but it seemed to me that there was one new thing that was made",sad
 a sort of responsibility man for man.  You understand me?,sad
 And then I came home and it was amazing.,sad
 There was no meaning in it here.,xxx
 The whole thing to them was sort of a bus accident. Then I went to work with father and that whole rat race again.,xxx
" I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow",sad
 because nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.,sad
" I felt wrong to be alive, to open the new bank book, to drive the new car, to see the new refrigerator.",sad
 I mean you can take those things out of war but,xxx
" when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've got to be a little better because of that.",sad
 Otherwise what you have is really just loot and there's blood on it.  I didn't want to take any of it.,sad
 I guess that included you.,sad
" I want you now, Annie.",xxx
" Annie, Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you.",hap
 Fine.,neu
 What flashlight?,xxx
 It's not yours.,fru
 It's ours.  It's mine too.,xxx
 You kept saying my flashlight as if it somehow is just yours.  How's that supposed to make me feel?,xxx
 Yes.,xxx
 I'm cold.,xxx
 It's after eleven let's go home.,ang
 There is no point in coming down here.,ang
 That's my point.,fru
 So let's go home.,fru
 Not particularly.,fru
 I just don't.  It's stupid.,ang
" Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around, and then swim away and then they die.",ang
 What are you so excited about?  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats.,ang
" Oh, Augie.",fru
 I'm just not.,ang
 Yes.,ang
 Last year you will also remember our shoes got wet.  I got sand in my panties.  We got in a big fight over nothing.  You got a sore throat and we did not see the Grunions.,xxx
 We didn't see them the first time either.,ang
 That's the wind.,fru
 About what?,ang
 It's ridiculous.,ang
 What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  This is great isn't it?  Look at this night we've got here.  It couldn't be better.,hap
" Actually, I wanted to go a little farther up the coast, get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid to miss it.  How you doing?",xxx
" Is that, is that-that's just foam isn't it?  I can't even tell",exc
" although if you can't tell, it probably isn't them.  It will probably be unmistakable.  Don't you think?  How you doing?",xxx
" Oh, no you know what I did?  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid I forgot my flashlight.",fru
" The flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one isn't there?",fru
 Whose is it?,sur
 Well sure.,fru
" No of course our flashlight, yours and mine, mi flashlight es su flashlight naturally.  How could we not think to bring it?",fru
 I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder do they always run during a full moon.  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Remember?,exc
" Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.",neu
" Ah, this is great, isn't it?  I didn't even think to bring a six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now.",hap
 I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.,xxx
" Oh, I wonder if they can hear me talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?",xxx
 Do you want my jacket?,xxx
 Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home?,fru
 Right.,fru
 That's my point too.,neu
" No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is is that there's no point in coming down here if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?",fru
 Why not?,xxx
 Honey this is natural phenomenon.  I mean this only happens once a year.  This is a great opportunity.,fru
 Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.,exc
" Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you, spawning or mating something like that.",fru
 This is the big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy.,exc
" Yeah, they do.",fru
 Okay but it's fish who do something none of the other fish do,fru
" like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.  There's mystery here and magic",exc
 a little bit of the unexplainable.  I don't see how you cannot be interested.,fru
 For real?,sur
 I don't get it.  The first time we came here to see it you said it was the best night of your life and last year I remember distinctly you were so excited to get here.  You stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn't even notice until we were in the car.,fru
 We weren't in a good spot.,fru
 We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.,ang
" I've got good instincts for these things.  Look there. What's that.  Is that?  Is that, is that-no it's just seaweed isn't it.",exc
" Ah, man this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean think about this.  I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute.",exc
 Out there someplace there's this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.,exc
 No one sent them a map or an invitation.  Just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one. They turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.,exc
 They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.,exc
 It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.,exc
 They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask question.  They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them here to this place,exc
 where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death.,exc
" Ah, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up.",exc
 Well so what do you think?,xxx
 What I said.,xxx
 About what?,xxx
 It's ridiculous.,xxx
 It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach.,ang
" Well sure everybody's told the same story.  It keeps us all coming back for more.  It keeps us all excited, keeps us thinking that life is going to start any minute now if we can just find the right spot and get in on the action.",xxx
 Well I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me.,xxx
 Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting.,ang
 We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.,ang
" For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.",ang
 We totally skipped. Right.,neu
" For heaven's sake, grow up we are not going to see the Grunions.",ang
 We never do.  Do we have we ever?,ang
 Twice is every time we've tried that's ever.,ang
" No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Clause.",xxx
" God I feel as though my entire life is going to be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up,",xxx
 and the fish won't show up.,ang
 You don't understand anything I'm saying.,fru
 I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this time will be the time but it never is.,fru
" For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.",xxx
 Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago right after we got married.,xxx
 We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes,sad
" and you popped the cork and while we were dancing, you said the softest most intimate things to me",sad
 right into my ear so that I could hear them as much as- so that I could feel them as much as hear them.,sad
" And I remember thinking this is it.  At last, at last I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.",sad
" Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle.",sad
 I would rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.,sad
 No.,neu
 No.,sad
 No.  No.,fru
 No.,fru
 No.,fru
 No.,fru
 No.,ang
 I want something to turn out the way it's supposed to.,xxx
" This what, what is this?  This isn't even anything.",ang
" Oh, right, sure this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.",ang
 But this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.,xxx
" This is just this.  I mean it includes a lot in everything but it's just not, you know, something else.  Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?",xxx
" I know you are, Augie.  Really I do.  I know you wanted this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and all but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.",sad
 I didn't say that.,fru
" For heaven's sake, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you.",fru
 Well don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?  You're the one who probably wishes you were with somebody else,fru
 somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.,sad
 Okay.  Fine.  So we're in the wrong spot but we're with the right person.,xxx
" Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty on the water doesn't it, big old white moon.",hap
" Oh, Augie you brought refreshments.",hap
 Well then I guess we don't need glasses.,hap
 I'm beginning to think you might be right.  I think this may be the spot after all.  Augie I'm sorry.,hap
 Or not.,xxx
" Well, so what do you think?",neu
 What I said.,xxx
 It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,xxx
 I'm not the only one.  Look at these people.,xxx
 Are we talking about the same thing?,xxx
" Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this the wrong way but are you having your period?",xxx
 Well then what's bugging you?,fru
" There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do their little fish business.  We go oh, ah look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home.",fru
 Why not?,fru
" There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do the little fish business.  We go oh, ah look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home.",xxx
 Why not?,fru
 We've missed them twice that's not ever.,fru
 We'll see them this year.,fru
 I thought you wanted to see it.,fru
" No, of course not.",fru
 It's just a fish.  Nothing to get traumatized over.,fru
 I've been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse.  You were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.,fru
 Let's see I took a shower.  You watched the news.  You said the Grunions are running tonight. I said great let's go.  I feel lucky tonight.,xxx
" Okay.  Uh, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals.  We're getting the car out of the garage.",xxx
 Wait a minute.  I've got it.,neu
" It was in the car right.  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?",neu
" That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time, right.  That's it.",exc
 Okay.  Right.  I got it.  Sure.  Of course.  Listen you want to dance?,xxx
 You want me to get some champagne?,neu
 Take off our shoes?,xxx
 Well what?  Want me to breath in your ear?,fru
 Want to get married again?,fru
 What?  What do you want a divorce?,fru
 A vacation?,fru
" A new carpet, a poodle, a backrub, ice cream, a suicide pact.  What?  What?  Carla what the hell do you want?",fru
 Well welcome to the human race.  You think this is what I had in mind.,xxx
" Do you think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish.",fru
 Do you think that I knew that there'd be times when you'd look at me like I'm a used Kleenex and times I would look at you and think holy hell when's the next flight to Alaska.,fru
" No, no I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and sand in our hair and wind in our",fru
" Sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will always pay themselves and ha, ha baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get,",fru
" you know what you get Carla, this.",xxx
 Yes it is.,xxx
 Right.,xxx
" No, I know me either.",xxx
 I'm doing the best I can.,fru
 Maybe if you were with somebody else too.,sad
" No, I know but still.  I know I don't make you happy.",sad
 Yeah?,sur
" Actually now that you mention it, no I don't.",neu
 I don't know.  It seemed like a good spot to me.,neu
 I mean look at the view you've got of the moon from here.,xxx
 Well look at what we got here.,exc
 It's not champagne.,neu
 You still cold?  Do you want to go home?,xxx
" Shh.  If we're very quiet, the fish might come.",xxx
 Or not.,xxx
 Do you think it's them?,xxx
 Nobody knows we're here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.,xxx
 Well what are we going to do?,xxx
 Now and always sweet.,xxx
 It was bound to come sooner or later.,xxx
 Ahh.  It sent shivers up my spine.,exc
 Behave exquisitely.,exc
 Certainly I shall probably do a court curtsy.,exc
 What is so horrible is that one can't stay happy.,xxx
 It's true the whole business is very poor joke.,exc
" Yes, meaning just that.",xxx
 Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.,exc
 Who's they?,neu
" If I must laugh at everything, I must laugh at us too.",xxx
" Oh, how long will it last, this ludicrous, over-bearing love of ours?",exc
 We always want to bicker and fight.,xxx
" Oh, dear shall we like that?",xxx
 What happens if one of us dies?  Does the one that's left still laugh?,neu
" Well that's serious enough, isn't it?",xxx
" Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.",xxx
" Elliott, worms don't pop.",xxx
" Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.",exc
 Which particular one?,exc
" Oh, Charles.  That was his name.  Charles he did wriggle so beautifully.",exc
" Yes, I know you did.  You threw him out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.",exc
 It went on intermittently for days.,xxx
 It burnt my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.,exc
 That was the first time you ever hit me.,xxx
 Then the manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.,exc
" How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.",exc
 And very much sillier.,exc
 Good God.,xxx
 I wonder.,fea
 It must be them then.,fea
" We'll be alright, darling.  Whatever happens, aren't we?",xxx
 I don't care then.,xxx
 Hello.  Hello.  What?  Wrong number.,xxx
 What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?,exc
 With the most perfect poise.,exc
" Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they?",exc
" Don't say that, my darling.",neu
 Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love.,xxx
 What does it all mean?  That's what I asked myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God what does it all mean?,xxx
" You mustn't be serious, my darling.  It's just what they want.",xxx
 All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.,xxx
" Laugh at them, be flippant, laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths",xxx
 flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.,xxx
 Certainly you must.  We are figures of fun alright.,xxx
 Well who knows?,neu
 No that fire will fade long with our passion.,xxx
 It all depends on how well we've played.,xxx
 Yes.  Yes.  with all his might.,xxx
" No, no it isn't.  Death is very laughable such a cunning little mystery.  All done with mirrors.",xxx
 So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.,xxx
 Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can like small quite idiotic little school children.,xxx
 Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.,xxx
" I don't mind what you do, see. you can paint yourself green all over",xxx
 and dance naked in the place Place Vendome and rush away with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best.,xxx
 Do you remember that awful scene in Venice?,neu
 The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed.,neu
 Horrible thing.  I hated it.,neu
 How long did that row last?,neu
 The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown.,neu
" Ah, we were much younger then.  That was a rouser wasn't it?",xxx
 You didn't hit me- I didn't hit you very hard.,xxx
 I shall never forget his face.,xxx
 We were very much younger then.,xxx
" As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",xxx
" There was nothing in that, you know that.",xxx
 Presents a trivial little broach.,xxx
 Not at all.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often.,xxx
 I did not.  You made the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.,xxx
" Just a little perhaps, nothing serious.",xxx
 What of it?,ang
 It gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.,xxx
" If you hadn't been so nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.",xxx
" Oh, dear.  I'm bored with this conversation.",fru
 No thanks.,fru
 I don't see why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.,xxx
 seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.,xxx
 It's become a habit with you.,ang
" Oh, don't be so stupid.",ang
 What?,ang
 Just making myself fascinating for you.,fru
 The woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute will you.,fru
" Oh, no it isn't",fru
" Oh, be quiet.",xxx
 It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.,ang
 Adders don't snap they sting.,ang
 They sting.,ang
" I don't care, okay.  Do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops.",ang
" Yes, I did quite a lot.",ang
 Mind your own business.,ang
 You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk.,ang
 You always had a weak head.,ang
" On, the contrary.  A child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",ang
" Oh, shut up.",ang
" Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.",ang
 Why?,ang
 There is no one upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.,ang
 They're away in Tunis.,xxx
" Turn it on again, please.",xxx
 Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.,ang
 You're far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.,ang
" Go away, go away.  I hate you.",ang
 Listen? Listen indeed.  I'm sick and tired of listening to you.  You damn sadistic bully.,ang
 Stop.,ang
" Stop, stop.  I hate you.  Do you hear?  You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.",ang
" This is the end do you understand?  The end,",ang
 finally and forever,ang
" Oh, I am.  Let go of me.",ang
" Oh, I hate you. It's a good thing that I found out in time what you're really like. Marry you again?  Never, never, never.",ang
 I'd rather die in torment. Beast.  Brute.  Calf swine.,ang
" As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",neu
 I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.,ang
 I remember it well bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.,xxx
 You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,ang
" You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?",xxx
 You let him kiss you.  You said you did.,ang
 What of it?,ang
 What about me?,ang
" That's a nice point of view, I must say.",ang
 So am I.  Bored stiff.  Want some brandy?,xxx
" I'll have some myself, I think.",neu
 No particular reason.  Anyway they were very small ones.,xxx
 You can hardly call three liquor glasses in the whole evening going on and on and on.,fru
 You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any at the moment.,xxx
" Really, Amanda.",ang
 Nothing.,ang
" Going somewhere, my dear?",ang
" Ah, that reply has broken my heart.",xxx
" As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.",xxx
" Yes, it is.",xxx
 It's a pity you don't have anymore brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.,xxx
" Snap, snap, snap like a little adder.",fru
 Non-sense they have bags of venom behind their fangs and they snap.,xxx
 They snap.,xxx
 Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,neu
 I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then.,xxx
" You must have had a riotous time.  No restraint at all, very enjoyable, you never had much anyhow.",xxx
 I'm not in the least drunk.,ang
 I think I mentioned once before that I had three minute liquor glasses of brandy the whole evening long.  A child of two couldn't get drunk on that.,fru
 Very interesting and how about a child of six and a child of four and a child of nine.,xxx
" They'd get up a splendid little debate about that, you know.  Intemperate tots.",xxx
 Very good idea.  I will.,ang
 You'd better turn that off I think.,xxx
 It's very late and it will annoy the people upstairs.,xxx
 There are people downstairs I suppose.,ang
 This is no time of year for Tunis.,ang
 I'll do no such thing.,xxx
 Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.,ang
 Turn it off.,xxx
" Amanda, listen.",ang
 Very amusing.,ang
" You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast. And I hope I never see you again as long as I live.",ang
 You're not going like this.,ang
 You're not.,ang
 Shut up.  Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on your bended knees.,ang
" You're a mean, evil minded, little tempered witch. I hope to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live. Whore.",ang
 Okay.  What's the problem?,neu
" Okay, um.  Do you have your photo ID with you?",neu
 Okay.  This is the wrong form.  I'm sorry.,neu
" I don't have the form.  You're going to have to go get in that line over there and they will give you the right form.  And after you fill it out, you can bring it back to me.",fru
 I don't have any of,fru
 I don't have any of them over here.  You're gonna have to go get in that line over there.  And they will give you a copy of the form.,fru
" Nope, I don't. I don't have-",fru
" No, I can't. That's-",fru
 I'm sorry.  You have to do things the way you have to do things here.  We have rules.,fru
" Go get in that-- Sir-- Sir, there are people in line behind you. you need",fru
" I'm sorry.  I'm sorry you're having a hard time,",fru
 but you're gonna have to go get in  that line to,fru
 twenty bucks? Please. Go get in that line over there.,neu
" Look, I'm having a really bad day.  I'm off in twenty minutes and I just really don't need this right now, okay.",fru
" And you're gonna have to go wait again, because that's the line you need.",fru
 I can't do that. It's against our rules. You can go get in that line over there or you can just go ahead and leave and come back another day.  Maybe there will be a shorter line.,fru
 I can't do that.,fru
" I'm sorry, but I can't do that.",fru
 So go get in the other line or leave.  Or I will have you escorted out by security.,ang
 Would you like to be kicked out of the D.M.V.?  You don't think that'll be a little embarrassing?,ang
 The one you just came from.,fru
 Yeah.  Thank you.  Have a pleasant day.,ang
" Yeah, hi.  Um, look, I -- all I'm trying to do right now is renew my license plate.  That's all.  I just need to get one of those little stickers.",neu
" And I've- I've- some lady -- I got in line.  I waited for about two hours um, and, I gave her this form",fru
" that she gave to me earlier. And she said oh, I gave you the wrong one by accident.  So I was hoping I could just fill out a new one, give it to you and sort of skip this whole line business.",fru
" Yes, I do.",neu
" This is -- okay, then just can I have the form that I need.",fru
 Don't you -- you don't have-,fru
 are you telling me you don't have a stack of them behind the desk?,fru
" But you're -- it's the same -- I mean, you can -- like I can't go behind your desk--",fru
 or I can't go behind there- you can go behind this person's desk and just grab the form. So if you could just do that; that would help me out a lot.,fru
" Look, can you please just-- --make this -- look, I look--",fru
 look-- It's  been- it's been two hours.  Can you please just make this easier on me and just go and get the form?  It's not- it's really not,fru
 What if I pay you money?,fru
" Can I pay you money?  Can I give you, like, twenty bucks and you'll go back there and get the form?",fru
" Come on.  Will you please?  I just --I look, I  cannot-- --just if I --",fru
" I don't care, well- You're having a bad -- I just waited in line for two hours.",fru
 Well I just -- I can't do that right -- can you please just grab the form? All you have to do is grab the form.  I'm not gonna ask anything else of you.,xxx
 That's all I- I just- That's all i want you to-,fru
" Rules, you just have to grab a piece of paper behind from somebody's desk",fru
 It's not rocket science.,ang
" Come -- just, please, just grab the form.  It's right over there.",fru
 I know it's right over there.,xxx
 Why are you being such a bitch?,fru
" Please, will you please -- will you please just grab the form?",fru
" Fine, which line is it?",fru
" Okay, fine.  I'll go over there.  Thanks, a lot.  You've been really helpful.",ang
 It's the first year of your child's life.,xxx
 You're just fine with this?,xxx
 You're just going to pick up and leave me and our baby and miss a year of our lives?,fru
" When you get back, think of all of the things that you're going to have missed.",xxx
 Don't go.,xxx
" Do you want to -- do you want to leave us behind?  I mean, I don't understand why you have to do this.",fru
" You've made a pledge to us, too.  Remember that day, we stood in front of each other and said 'til death do us part.  Put on some rings and it's supposed to mean something.",xxx
 Can't you ask them?  Can't you go back and ask them if you could -- I don't know if you could change  assignments or something and you could stay here?,fru
" Why not?  You could, at least, try.  They have to understand",fru
 You won't even know your child when you come back.  This -- isn't there someone you could talk to?,sad
 Explain the situation to them and then you can stay here.,fru
" And what happens if, at the end of that year, they ask you to stay longer?  Are you just going to agree?  Are you just going to absentmindedly brainwashedly do whatever it is they tell you to do?",fru
 Then why do you have to go a year at all?,fru
 Well unagree.  Tell them that you can't leave right now.  I can't do this by myself.  I can't do this without you.,fru
 This is supposed to be a partnership.  We're supposed to do this together. I'm not supposed to be left here to do this by myself while you leave.,xxx
" What am I supposed to do, read your letters?",xxx
" There has to be something.  I mean, we can't just live with this.  It's not -- it just won't work this way.",fru
 Just tell them no.,fru
" Then, can't you please try something?  If you go and ask them and they say no, then I would understand, but you're not even willing to ask.",fru
 Can't you just make an effort?  Can't you just try?,fru
 When do you leave?,sad
 A week.  You're giving me a week to be okay with this.,ang
 Well it doesn't seem like you're that bothered by it.,fru
" If you really cared so much, you'd find a way out.",fru
" Fine, fine.  We have to be together.  If you can't stay here, then I'll go with you.  I don't care where you go.  We'll go, too.  I'm not staying behind.",xxx
" It's a free world.  I can go where I want.  Wherever you are, that's where we're going to go.",fru
 Difficult.  You're leaving for a year. We have a newborn child and you're leaving.  I don't think I'm being difficult.,xxx
" I'm finding a way to make it work.  And I will go wherever you go.  Whatever I have to do, I will make this work.",fru
 You're not really giving me a lot of options.,fru
 But I'm supposed to be okay with you going there.,fru
 I'm not going to stay here and wait.,xxx
 I can't do it.,xxx
 It's only going to be a year.,sad
 There's really -- there's nothing I can do.,xxx
 There's nothing I --,fru
" It's -- look, it's only a year.  It'll go by quickly.  Okay.",fru
" I know, but I'll be back then.  And - and- and we'll have -- we have the rest of our lives.",fru
 I can't do that.  I have to go.,fru
 I've made a pledge.  I can't not do this at this point.,fru
 I know that. I know that. I know that.,fru
" There's nothing I can do.  I mean, I have to go.",neu
" And this is what I do.  This is -- I mean, this is my life.  And I know that you're part of my life, too, and I mean, it's only -- it's just going to be a year.  I'll be back.",fru
 It's not- it's not- It's not like that.  It's not like that.  I can't do that.,fru
 Because it's impossible.  There's -- I just can't.  I can't.,fru
" Look, honey, it's- it's- it's only going to be a year.",fru
 It's only going to be a year. I'm not going to miss my son's entire life.,fru
 I'm not going to stay more than a year.  I've  agreed to a year,fru
 Because I've already agreed to that.,fru
" Yes, you can.  Yes, you can.  You know you can.  You're a strong person.",fru
 It is. It is. It is. It is. I'm going to write you every day.,fru
 What else can we do?  I -- we don't have a choice in this.  Do you understand?  You can't come with me and I can't stay here.  That's all there is to it.,fru
 We don't have a choice.  I have to do this.,fru
" I can't do it.  I'd love to.  I mean, I don't - if you understand, I don't want to stay.",fru
" I mean, I don't want to -- I don't want to leave.  I want to stay here with you.",fru
 I've asked already.  I can't go back.,fru
" It can't happen.  I have to go.  I want to stay really bad, but I can't.  There's just no -- I don't have an option.",fru
 Next week.,fru
" You can't make it out like I'm happy about this.  I mean, I didn't -- I didn't want to put you in this situation.",fru
" I am.  I mean, I don't know.  I don't know what else to tell -- you know, I mean, I can tell you.  I don't know what else to do. I mean, I've been forced into this situation.",fru
 There's nothing I can do.  I-- I,fru
 They won't let you come along.  It's not going to happen.,fru
 Are you kidding? Please don't be difficult about this.,fru
 [BREATHING],fru
" Look, I--",fru
 Where I'm going is not the safest place on the earth.  Okay.,fru
 But I've been trained.  You have no training.,fru
 You have to.  Do you understand me?  You have to.,fru
" Well I guess we're at a stalemate then, aren't we?",fru
" Wait, what?",xxx
" Oh, my God.  Congratulations.",xxx
 I can't -- how did you do it?  What happened?,exc
 [LAUGHTER] Well you paint a romantic picture.,exc
 Did she cry?,exc
" Oh, my God.  How long have you been planning on doing this?",exc
 I can't believe this.  You're getting married. It's crazy!,exc
" Yeah, it is.",exc
" Yeah, I would love to. Thanks. [LAUGHTER]",exc
" Oh, my God, where -- have you guys talked about where you're going to get married or--",exc
" Oh, my God.",exc
 Are you going to get married like on the beach barefoot or like fancier?  Like in a church.,exc
 Well I don't know.  Throwing it out there.,exc
 Okay.,xxx
" Are you going to have a big wedding or like keep it really small like just, you know, family and really close friends?  Or, I mean--",xxx
 It's so exciting.  What's the ring look like?,exc
 Big and shiny.  You're such a guy. [LAUGHTER],exc
 I'm so excited for you. That's great. I'm so-,exc
 Well I'm glad you told me.,xxx
 It's fantastic.  I -- congratulations. It's amazing.,exc
 And how did she feel about that?,xxx
 Well that's good.  It'll be a great wedding.  You're willing to compromise on things.,xxx
 She's going to let you have say in the wedding choices?  That's pretty impressive. Very forward-thinking woman. [LAUGHTER],xxx
 And brown.,xxx
 This is why men don't plan weddings. [LAUGHTER],hap
 All fruit and brown. [LAUGHTER],exc
" So, um, well, I just -- I kind of wanted to, you know, tell you that I'm actually -- I proposed to Kate and we're going to get married.",xxx
" Yeah. Yeah, I proposed to her yesterday. We're getting -- we're engaged now and we're going to -- we're going to get married in about eight months.",xxx
" Yeah, it's pretty amazing, huh?",exc
 Well I decided to take her sailing,xxx
" and we were just out on the water and, you know, I just -- I had the ring with me.  And I was like let's do this.  And she was like okay and then we're getting married.",xxx
" Well I didn't want it to be like cheesy, you know.",hap
" She didn't cry, but she was laughing a lot and it was very exciting, so...",hap
" Honestly, it was kind of quickly.  It was actually only in the past couple months.",hap
" Yeah. Yeah. So- I know.  I know. I know.  It's weird 'cause it's like the beginning of the rest of my life, you know.",hap
" But uh- no, I mean, you know.  You know, I really want you to like, you know, sort of",hap
" help Kate out with like planning stuff. I mean, if you want to.  I mean, you guys are good friends anyway so I figured, you know, if you guys want to like -- I mean, you know, I'm sure you enjoy that kind of thing.",xxx
 Okay. Well there you go.,exc
 I think we're going to -- we're going to -- we want to do it in Hawaii and just fly everybody in.,xxx
" I just -- 'cause, I mean, Hawaii just has like the best fruit buffets.  And so I'm just going to say forget, you know, all like kind of meats and all that stuff.",xxx
" It's just going to be like a all fruit--fruit buffet wedding, plus a cake.",xxx
 Barefoot?,exc
" Um, no, no, no.  It'll be in like a park near the beach.",xxx
 Yeah.  But I'm really excited.  So and everybody's going to come out and it'll be a great time.  And--,exc
" It'll be kind of small, but not, you know, not tiny, you know.  I want to have, you know, as many people as we can afford to fly out to Hawaii and put up there for--",xxx
 It's big and shiny.  I don't know.  It's silver and--,exc
" Yeah, I don't know. [LAUGHTER] But, yeah, so anyway -- well I wanted to tell you that, you know, 'cause you're one of my good friends and you're Kate's- one of her best friends and-",hap
" Yeah, yeah. She was actually -- she was going to tell you but I told her that I wanted to tell you and she had to work today anyway, so I decided to-",hap
" Yeah, yeah.",hap
" Thank you.  I'm really -- I'm really excited.  And it's -- I don't know, it's like a little -- it's like a little scary, 'cause I'm like, ah, you know, it's the first time I've ever done anything like this.",exc
" But, you know, it's like I really love her and I really just -- I can't imagine spending my life with anybody else but her.  So, you know, it's like I know that's the right thing.  And if you have to, you know, if you have to question that, you know, don't- don't do it.  So we're going to do it.",hap
" And it's going to -- the -- you know, I told her that I just -- I want the color brown to be as an integral in the wedding.  And, um, maybe some greens and blues.",hap
 She's okay with it.,hap
" Exactly, exactly, exactly.  So--",xxx
" Well, I mean I just told her--Well I just said, you know, hey, these are my suggestions.",hap
 All fruit and the color brown. Just that. That's all- that's my only request.,hap
 Yeah.  Well maybe--maybe you're right. Maybe there's something to that.,hap
" So, um, anyway, do you want to order now?   So, um I mean--",neu
 Well there has to be something you haven't tried.,neu
 What about like a temp agency?,neu
" Have you gone, like, signed up with a temp agency?  Maybe they can help.",neu
" Right, but you have -- I mean, you have to keep on them.  You have to keep calling and reminding them that you're still looking and",neu
" I mean, you have to be really aggressive about it.",neu
" Well, I mean, if it's that bad, maybe you're gonna have to take something that doesn't really fit, you know.  Like maybe you'll have to do something else for a while.  Find a new field, new skill.",neu
" Well then you're choosing to be unemployed, really.",neu
" If you're not willing to try and work with it and find something and, you know, I mean, there are things you could do.",neu
" Well maybe, you know, your luck it is just down and the market for your particular field is down and maybe you just need to look into doing something else for a while.",neu
" I mean, I'm not saying that you should, you know--",neu
 Excuse me?,sur
 It's my fault 'cause you didn't do what I told you to?,neu
 Well that sounds like your fault.,neu
 You didn't do what I told you to do.,neu
 That's amazing logic that you managed to turn that around and make it my fault.,xxx
 I think maybe you can't get employed because you aren't willing to take responsibility for your own actions.,neu
 Really?  Whose fault is it you don't have a job?,neu
 [LAUGHTER],neu
" You see what you just did there, though?",xxx
" Oh, man, I just -- I don't know what to do.  I don't know what to do.  It's like every job, you know, I go to; every job I apply to,",fru
" it's just like nobody- nobody wants to hire me. It's been years, I mean, do you understand, years?  Like, I'm -- you know what I mean, it's like I've been collecting unemployment for so long now, it's just like I just -- I can't take it.  I don't know what to do.  I mean, I'm just like losing my mind.",fru
" I-I'm not kidding.  I've tried everything.  Like I've gone to every business and local, you know,",fru
" local business in- in the area and I can't- I can't get anything.  Like, nobody -",fru
" there's just like no jobs available.  I mean, it's just like, God.",neu
" Yeah, I tried that.  And there was like, yeah, like I did like one thing once.  But, like, that's not -- it doesn't last very long.  And it's not enough to live on.",fru
" Yeah, I do.  I do.  You don't understand.",fru
 I- You don't understand. I don't have a job.  All- My job is to look for a job.  I don't do anything else.,fru
" But, like, it's been years now and I just can't seem to get anything that really fits.  It's just it -- I -- it drives me absolutely insane.",fru
" No, no, no, no, no.  I can't- I can't do that.  I can't, I- because if I'm not- if I'm not- if I'm not doing something that I love, then I can't -- I can't- I mean it's- what's the point?",fru
 I'm not choosing. I'm not-,fru
" No, but I'm try- but like all the things that I-it's like I apply to all these places and none of them",fru
" -- I mean, I don't understand.  It's like -- I mean, I feel like I'm qualified enough.  I just don't understand.  Like, I mean, it's just like a matter of circumstance, but it's been three years, you know, three years.",fru
 This is stupid.,fru
" You know what, this is your fault.",fru
 It's your fault 'cause -cause you always told me to- to do this and I did that instead.  And I didn't take your advice and - and- but you sort of were like were telling--,fru
" Yeah, exactly.",fru
 Yeah.,fru
 That's 'cause you always tell me to do the wrong thing.  And I thought this time it was -- I was gonna be right by going with the opposite thing. So it's your fault because,fru
" -because you were always wrong and-and-and this time you were right. And-and I didn't -- yeah, that's why.",fru
" Well, I mean, it makes sense, doesn't it, hmm?",neu
 That's not true.  I take responsibility for my own actions.,neu
 Yours.  I don't--,neu
" I had- No, I don't.  I'm sorry.  I just totally screwed this one up.  You can stop it I guess.",oth
" Hi, how can I help you?",neu
 Mmhmm.,neu
 I'm sorry.,neu
 Right.,neu
" Oh, oh, you didn't.",xxx
 I thought you lost your luggage.,xxx
" Uh. Okay.  I -- first of all, I'm very sorry you lost your bag.",neu
" Um, but, actually, our policy is a fifty dollar",neu
 refund--coverage of the bag that was lost. yes,neu
" That's our policy, sir.",neu
 I can't do that.,neu
" Uh, no, actually, no I'm not.",xxx
 I'm very sorry.  I understand you're frustrated. You just got off of a flight.,fru
 We'll cover fifty.,neu
 We only cover fifty do-,fru
 We only cover fifty dollars worth of lost items.,fru
 I'm very sorry.,fru
 I'm very sorry.  I understand you're upset.  You just got off a long flight.,neu
 We really -- we want to work with you. We really -- we want to help.,fru
 I understand that.  I would know if it was mine. Um-,neu
 But it's not.  It's yours.  I understand.,neu
 I know.  We want to work with you.  We will give you the fifty dollars but I'm--,fru
" Yeah, we don't do that.  I can go ahead and send you--",fru
" We will definitely keep an eye out for your bag. We will try to find it.  We will, you know, fill out the form for missing items.",fru
 No one can make the three check thing happen 'cause we don't do that.,fru
 I can write you the one check.,fru
 All- all that my supervisor could do is the exact same thing that I'm offering to do.,fru
" I'd be happy to give you a cup of coffee, too.",fru
 We'll just throw that in--gratuitously.,fru
" No, I don't. See, I could lose my job if I did that.",fru
 And your bag is not my concern.,fru
 The fifty dollars I'm going to give you for your bag is really all I'm concerned with.,fru
 I'm more than happy to not argue about it.  I will give you your fifty dollar certificate.,fru
 You can go ahead and go fill out the form. We'll look for your bag.,fru
 Then that would be lying.,fru
 I'm sorry.  We can only issue one fifty dollar certificate to cover the lost bag for one person.,fru
" I understand you're frustrated, but--",neu
 I know. I understand it's personal-- It's personal to you. I get that.,neu
" But if you want to just sit down, you know, maybe have a cup of tea, calm down a little bit, we'll go ahead and we'll do what we can for you. you okey",fru
" And I'm looking forward to that.  However, I can't do that. I would lose my job.",fru
" Oh, yes.",fru
" I'm sorry, really.  But--",fru
 That I'm sorry?,fru
" Yeah, hi.  Look--Um, okay.  Here's the thing.",fru
 Just arrived from London--,xxx
 lost my luggage. Your airline--,fru
" lost my luggage. I didn't lose it. No, it's not like I left it somewhere and somebody took it.",fru
" It was lost.  I waited on the conveyor -- near the conveyor belt to see, you know, where -- then the baggage claim and see if it would- it would come out.",fru
" Didn't come out.  I spoke to somebody, a local authority figure.",fru
" And he told me to come to this desk here so I can, uh, at least get, uh, the hundred- hundred and fifty dollars that- that I'm owed for my loss.",fru
 'Cause that's roughly how much the bag plus all its contents was worth.,fru
 fifty dollars?,ang
" fifty dollars. No way, no.",ang
" I don't but the thing is, I don't care about your policy.",ang
 You understand?,ang
" What I want you to do is I want you to write three of those, as if I were three people.  Okay.  You can write -- you can just put my name on all --",fru
 But what I'm telling you is that's what you're going to do.,fru
" No, no, because, look, I don't care what your policy says.  I mean--",ang
 You understand that the contents of my bag- The contents of my bag cost a hundred and fifty dollars.,ang
 You--,ang
 No.  No.  No.  What I need you to do -- I need you to write checks for -- I need you to write three of them. That'll be satisfactory.,ang
" Just -- you can fill out the form--We can fill out - no, no, no, we can fill out the form three times.",ang
 And then that'll be that. It's going to be fine. Just-,fru
" I'm going to get very upset.  Like, I mean, I'm- I'm upset right now but I'm going to get really upset if you- if you don't do the check thing.",xxx
" You don't understand. You don't understand, actually.  You don't understand because it was my luggage that was lost.  Okay.",fru
" Yeah.  If it was yours, but it's not. It's mine.  Okay. So just--",ang
" No, it's not going to be -- but it's not going to be fifty, it's going to be a hundred and fifty.  You're going to write three, you understand, three of- of the forms.  You're going to write three of them out and then give it to me.",xxx
 You- you- you- you're misunderstanding me.  You're going to do that.,fru
" Look, can I just -- can I speak to your manager, please?  'Cause I- I really -- I don't, um -- I mean, I just don't want to deal with -- I know that -- I mean, I know this isn't your fault,",fru
 but I need to speak to somebody who can make the three check thing happen.,ang
" But what I'm talk -- but I'm just,just- please let me--",fru
 But if I could just speak directly -- if I could just speak directly to your-- to your superior person,fru
 then that would be helpful to me because I just feel like if- you don't think you have the power to write three checks but you actually do. see?,fru
 But your job is not my concern. My concern is getting my luggage.,fru
" Look, I don't -- look, can we just not argue about this.  Like--",fru
 So what if- what if we- what if we do three forms,fru
 with different names on them? That-,fru
" but, no. See, 'cause",fru
 if we have three forms then I can get the hundred and fifty.,fru
" Just please, will you please just work with me here? Just -- all I'm asking you to do is just work with me. I know -- I know that you get lots of people all day long who give you shit, give you crap, but",fru
" um, you know, I -- this is my bag and I need the hundred and fifty dollars. Please.",fru
 Please.,ang
" I'm already calm. Okay, I'm calm. I'm calm.",ang
" Just all I need you to do is just fill out three forms and I'll leave you alone forever, forever.  I'll never -- we'll never see each other again.",fru
 But that's not going to-- But you don't understand. You're looking forward to never seeing me again.,fru
 But never seeing me again is not going to happen until you give me the three checks.,fru
 I don't -- I'm not- I'm not convinced.,fru
" Yeah.  If you were really sorry, you'd give me the three checks.",ang
" So why don't we just do that and stop this nonsense, hmm?  Hmm?",ang
" Hey, how you doing?",sad
 I'm sorry.,sad
" I know- I know there's nothing I can say that will really help, but--",sad
 I'm sorry.  It's never easy.,sad
" But, I'm here if there's anything you need.  I mean, you just have to ask.  I know --",sad
 --it doesn't really do anything.  But--,sad
 I know.  It never is.,sad
" How's, um -- how's his parents doing?",sad
" I mean, what do you want to do?  Do you want to- do you want to talk about it?  Do you-",sad
" Well I know it's not a lot of help or anything, but at least you got to know him.  I mean, at least you had the time with him that you did.",sad
" I mean, we can be grateful for that.",sad
 You feel that way now because you're upset.  But you don't really think that.,sad
" It'll get better.  I know it doesn't help, but it will get better and you will remember all of the good things that you guys had; all of the memories that you have with him that were happy and you'll be grateful for those.",sad
" Just life, in general?",xxx
" I agree.  If I knew how to make that happen, I would certainly help you.",sad
" When's the service? Can- can we help?  Is there anything, I mean--",sad
" Seems like if the whole world's sad, then it's okay for you to be.",sad
 I know.,sad
" I don't have any magic answers.  But,",sad
" I mean, as- as cliche as it is, as long as people who loved him remember him, then it's not a waste, you know.",sad
 Thanks.,sad
" I know.  I just -- I don't know.  It's just weird because you have somebody who's, you know,",sad
 a major part of your life and then they're gone.  And I don't know.  That's not really -- it's never really happened to me before.,sad
 Yeah.,sad
 Thanks.,sad
 I just -- it's just not fair.,sad
" I mean, they're, you know, they're upset.  It's like you know, they",sad
 feel the same way everybody else does.,sad
" [BREATHING] I mean, there's nothing really to talk about.  He's gone and I'll never see him again.",sad
 Yeah.,sad
" Yeah, I don't know.  Sometimes I wish I didn't know him.  So I wouldn't--",sad
 This is just -- this is a terrible life.  I just don't understand.,sad
" I mean, it's just not fair.  Like, I don't know.  Why people -",sad
" there should just be some sort of rule that people don't die until they're older, 'cause then, at least, it's expected.",sad
 I don't know what to do.,sad
" I mean, you- you can go.  I don't know.  I don't know what else.",sad
 I hope it rains.  Somehow that'll make me feel more comfortable.,sad
 Yeah.,sad
 I just wish there was some way to just bring him back to life magically.,sad

 No. Football's boring.,xxx
 I'll go to basketball games.,neu
 Maybe some golf matches.,neu
 Do they even have any golf matches? I don't even know.,xxx
 I don't know.  Do they have golf?  Do they have- Does U.S.C. have a -- I don't know if they have a golf team.,neu
" That I'll go to.  Definitely go to women's volleyball.  Women's volleyball, swimming, tennis.",xxx
" And then men's basketball.  And -- oh, well not women's basketball.",xxx
" No, I'm not going to go to a football game.",neu
 Forget it. Forget it. Forget it. No way.,neu
 I do -- I will need to get a gun-,neu
 You've got a point there.,xxx
 I'll take that in consideration.  Alright.,xxx
" Okay.  Um, but, no, I, uh, I do need to get a gun soon, though, 'cause I mean",neu
 I need to get like a -- just a small little gun just 'cause -- or like a taser or something or just like a butterfly knife,neu

 Well I need to defend myself from,neu
 Hi.  I've been on the phone for an hour trying to get a little discrepancy on my bill fixed.  I was charged for two hundred dollars worth of calls that I didn't make.,fru
 I'm positive.  They came from like another state.,fru
" Uh. Yeah, I just gave it to the automated thing like five times.",fru
 Okay.  three two three six nine seven five zero six six.  Can we move on?,fru
" Okay, cool.",xxx
 Yes.,xxx
" Yes, and I've been through all of the menus, pushed one and star and pound and all of that stuff and I'm just trying to get through to a person who can",fru
" take off the charges that came from like Nebraska or wherever because, obviously, I didn't make those.",fru
 So can you please refund the mischarged charges,fru
 I did not make the calls from B.F.E. Nebraska.,fru
 So could you discretion it back?,fru
" Okay, but that's like half",fru
 of the money that I was charged that I didn't make those calls.,fru
" Okay, no, look, I- I- I- I'm really -- I'm trying to be patient.  I know this isn't your fault.  I know that you didn't do it",fru
" but, at the same time, I have been through an hour of little robot voices telling me what I needed to do.",fru
 And I did everything they said.  And now i'm talking to you and you're supposed to put the money back on my account because I didn't make the calls and I'm really tired of dealing with this because I didn't even,xxx
 Excuse me?,fru
 How long does that take?,fru
 I have to wait a few weeks for people come go through my things to get the money back that I didn't spend?,fru
 Really?,sur
 You're just going to put it back on my account.,neu
 So you're just going to take care of this for me?,sur
" Oh, my God, thank you so much.",hap
" I really appreciate this. I know it's not policy or whatever but, seriously",hap

 You too.,neu
 Thank you for calling Sprint.  We care about everybody.  How can I help you?,fru
 Are you sure you didn't make them?,neu
" Can I get your phone number, please?",fru
 I'm going to need it again.  I need to look at your file.  If you want me to look at your file--,fru
 Okay.,neu
" Umm, Miss Aruckman",neu
 I am seeing the two hundred dollar charge.,neu
 Well I'm looking at these.,fru
 So you're saying that you didn't make these calls.,neu
" Well I mean, I'm supposed to use discretion in the situation and, um--",fru
 All I can do for you right now is give you a hundred dollars.,neu
 What I can,neu
 What I can do for you is give you a hundred dollars right now and fill out complaint form,neu
 which you- which you'll have to go into a local Verizon dealer--  or Sprint.,neu
" Ma'am, I understand that.",fru
" Ma'am, I - I - I understand that. I understand that. What I can do for you right now is what I'm telling you is that I can do- I can give you a hundred dollars back and then you'll have to fill out a complaint form and then you'll get -- there'll be some investigation. Some men will show up at your house and go through your things.",fru
 And then then you'll get some money back.,fru
 A few weeks.  You won't even know that they were there.,neu
" Okay.  You know what?  I just don't feel like doing this anymore.  Um, you can have all the money back, two hundred dollar, right now.",fru
" Yeah.  That's fine.  I just -- that's fine. Yeah, I mean, it doesn't make any difference to me.  I mean, it's not like it's going to cost my job or anything.",neu
" I mean, technically, that's policy.  But, like, I mean, I don't really care about -- nobody really cares about policy here.",neu
 Sure.,neu
 You're welcome.,neu
" No, no, no, it's cool.  It's cool.  It's cool.  So, um",neu
" You know, so- I mean, are you doing anything later?  Or um",neu
" Oh, I don't know.  I mean, I don't know.  I just thought, you know, maybe you want to get some co--I mean, I'm actually -- wait, where do you live?  Oh, you're in Los Angeles, I see.  Oh, no, that sucks 'cause I'm in, actually in Alabama.",neu
" God, that's like a whole problem with like-- But, no, I mean, hey-- if you ever",neu
" if you ever come out to Montgomery, I mean, you know, just -- just call up, you know, call up the operator and I'll-- I'll be here. So, um.",neu
 Alright. Take Care.,neu
 What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.,neu
 How could he see it?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed.,xxx
 When?,sur
 What was he doing out here at four in the morning?,xxx
 Did you talk to him?,xxx
 He cried hard?,xxx
 What was he doing out here at that hour?  He's dreaming about him again.  He's walking around at night.,xxx
 He's getting just like after he died.  What's the meaning in that?,sad
 What?,sur
" What do you mean, dishonest?",fru
 What do you want to do?  Argue with him?,fru
 You can't say that to him.,ang
 How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?,ang
" To you it is and to me, but not to him.  You can talk yourself blue in the face, but there's no body and no grave, so where are you?",ang
" The trouble is the Goddamn newspapers.  Every month some boy turns up from nowhere, so the next boy is going to be Larry.  So we have to keep--",xxx
 Why?,neu
" Well I've got an idea, but what's the story?",xxx
" Well that's only your business, Chris.",neu
 What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.,ang
 Well you want to make sure your father isn't going to have --,neu
 I'm just saying.,fru
 I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.,ang
" From father's point of view, he's not dead.  And you have no right to take his girl.",ang
" Now you can go on from there if you know where to go. But I'm telling you I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.",fru
 Now what can I do for you?,fru
 You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that.,xxx
 Did you ask Annie yet?,xxx
 How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does.,neu
" The trouble is, you don't see enough women.  You never did.",neu
 I don't see why it has to be Annie.,ang
" Well that's a good answer, but it don't answer anything.  He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl, you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what happens to your father?  Do you know?  Because I don't.",xxx
" Alright, then, mom.",fru
 Yes we did. Do you want to keep going?,neu
 Just give it some more thought.,neu
 What the hell is this?,ang
 Are you crazy?,ang
 You've got a business here.  What the hell is this?,ang
 Must you be inspired?,ang
 You mean -- tell me something.  You mean you'd really leave the business?,xxx
 You don't want to think like that.,ang
" Alright.  But just don't think like that because what the hell did we work for?  That's all for you, Chris.  The whole shooting match is just for you.",ang
" But don't think that way, you hear me?",ang
" I don't understand you, do I?",xxx
" Yeah, I can see that.",xxx
 He saw it.,neu
 He was out here when it broke.,neu
 About four this morning.  I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right there when it cracked.,xxx
" I don't know.  After it cracked, he ran back in the house and cried in the kitchen.",xxx
 No.  I - I figured the best thing was to leave him alone.,xxx
 I heard him right through the floor of my room.,xxx
 I guess he is.,xxx
" I don't know the meaning of it, mom.  But I know one thing; we made a terrible mistake with dad.",fru
 Being dishonest with him.  That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.,xxx
 You know that Larry's not coming back.  And I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,xxx
 I don't want to argue with him but it's time he realized that nobody believes Larry's alive anymore.,fru
 Why shouldn't he dream of him?  Walk the nights waiting for him.,xxx
" Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we have no hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for years, now.",xxx
 We've gotta say it to him.,ang
" For God's sake, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.",ang
" Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.",xxx
" Alright, alright, alright.  Listen.  You know why I asked Annie here don't you?",fru
 You know why.,fru
 Going to ask her to marry me.,neu
 You know it's not only my business.,fru
 Then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it?,xxx
" Well, then you know it's not only my business.",ang
" Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  Isn't it your business, too, if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things.",ang
 She's not Larry's girl.,fru
" I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer.  My whole bloody life, time after time after time.",fru
 To hell with that.,fru
 I wanted to get this settled first.,neu
" Well if she does, then that's the end of it.  From her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  We'll find out.  Then we'll thrash it out with dad. Right, mom?  Don't avoid me.",xxx
 So what?  I'm not fast with women.,xxx
 Because it is.,fru
 Line?,fru
" Alright, then, mom.  Did we skip something?  No.  Alright, then, mom.",neu
" Yeah, let's keep going.",neu
 I've given it three years' of thought.  I'd hope that if,fru
" father forgot about Larry, we'd have a regular wedding and everything happy.  If I can't get that here, then I'll have to get out.",sad
 I'll get out.  I'll get married and live someplace else.  Maybe New York.,xxx
 I've been a good son too long; a good sucker.  I'm through with it.,fru
 The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,ang
" Yes.  I like getting an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening, I want it beautiful.",ang
 I want a family.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to.  Annie's in the middle of that.  Now where do I find it?,xxx
" Yes, on this I would.",neu
 Then you help me stay here.,neu
 I know that.  Just you help me stay here.,fru
 I am thinking that way.,xxx
" No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.",fru
 Why did he invite her here?,ang
 Why does that bother you?,neu
" She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why, all of a sudden--",ang
 Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,ang
 He's not going to marry her.,ang
 It's got that about it.,ang
" What's going on here, Joe?",ang
" Now listen, kid. Now, listen.",neu
" She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.",ang
" Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men.  Why hasn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited.",ang
" Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know, again, that I'm right.",ang
" Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",ang
" I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since he invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.",ang
" Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.",ang
 Laugh.  Laugh at me.  But why did that happen the very night that she came here?,ang
 She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look.  Look at it.  Joe--,ang
" Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone",ang
" Only last week, a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.",xxx
" You, above all, have got to believe.  You.",ang
 Just don't stop believing.,xxx
 I can't help it.,sad
" Oh, God, line.",neu
" Why does- why, does that bother you?",xxx
" Well, maybe- maybe he just wanted to see her.",xxx
 What do you mean?  He grew up next door to the girl all his life.  Why shouldn't he want to -- why shouldn't he want to see her again?,fru
 Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anymore than he told you.,xxx
 How do you know he's even thinking about it?,neu
 Well so what?,neu
 Line.,neu
" Oh.  Now listen, kid.",xxx
 You can't read her mind.,xxx
 How do you know why she waited?,xxx
" Look, it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for?",fru
 What do you want me to do? What do you want?,fru
" But, Kate--",fru
 Calm yourself.,fru
 Calm yourself.,fru
" Alright, alright.  Calm yourself.",fru
 Why me above all?,fru
" What does that mean, me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking.",xxx
" What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?",ang
 You're the only one I know who loves his parents.,xxx
" It's okay.  It's a good thing.  You know, it's lovely here and the air is sweet.",xxx
" No, not sorry, but I'm not going to stay.",xxx
" In the first place, your mother as much as told me to go.",xxx
 You saw that and then you've been kind of--,xxx
" Well, kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.",xxx
" I knew they would, your mother, anyway.",xxx
" From her point of view, why else would I come?",xxx
 I guess this is why I came.,xxx
" Chris, I've been ready a long, long time.",xxx
 I almost got married two years ago.,xxx
 You started to write me.,xxx
 Every day since.,hap
" I was waiting for you, Chris.  'Til then, you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  You sure can be ambiguous, you know.",hap
 I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I've done is sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.,hap
 Not like that you're not.,xxx
" Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What is it, Chris?",xxx
" No, what is it, Chris?  Your mother?",xxx
" Then what's wrong.  Even in your letters, there was something ashamed.",xxx
 You've got to tell me.,xxx
 It wouldn't work this way.,xxx
" Yeah, sure.",xxx
 How many?,sad
" Oh, gees.",sad
 And do you still feel that way?,xxx
" Because you mustn't feel that way anymore, Chris.  Because you have a right to everything you have, everything, Chris; to me, too.",xxx
" And your money, there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  You should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.",xxx
 What'll I do with a fortune?,hap
" I know.  It went out of style, didn't it?",xxx
 So you're not sorry you came?,xxx
 Why?,xxx
 What?,xxx
 The trouble is I planned on sneaking up on you over a period of a week or so.  But they take it for granted that we're all set.,xxx
 How did you know?,xxx
 Well wouldn't you want to?,xxx
 I guess you know this is why I asked you to come.,xxx
" Ann, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you.",xxx
 I have no imagination.  That's all I know to tell you.  I'm embarrassing you.,xxx
 I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted someplace we'd never been; someplace where we'd be brand new to each other.,xxx
" You think this is wrong, don't you; this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to win you away from anything.",xxx
 Then he's gone forever?  You're sure?,xxx
 Why didn't you?,xxx
 You felt something that far back?,xxx
" Anne, why didn't you let me know?",xxx
" Anne, give me a kiss.  Give me a -",xxx
" I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.  How long, how long I've waited to kiss you.",xxx
" Anne, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.",xxx
 I kissed you.,xxx
 Let's drive somewhere.  I want to be alone with you.,xxx
" No, no, nothing like that.",xxx
" Yes, I suppose there has been.  But it's going from me.",sad
 I don't know where to start.,sad
" It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?",sad
 Well I lost them.,sad
 Just about all.,sad
 It takes a little time to toss that off because they weren't just men.,sad
" For instance, one time it'd been raining several days.  And this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks; put them in my pocket.  That's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.",sad
 They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.,xxx
" And I got this idea watching them go down, everything was being destroyed, see?  But, to me, it seemed there was one new thing that was made,",sad
 a kind of responsibility.  Man for man.  You understand me?  And then I went home and it was incredible.,sad
" There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was some sort of bus accident.  Then I went to work for dad and that whole rat race again.  I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow",sad
 because nobody was changed.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive;,sad
" to open that bank book; to drive the new car; to see the new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take these things out of a war, but when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.",sad
" You have to be a little better because of that.  Otherwise, we have is really loot and there's blood on it.  I don't want to take any of it.  I guess that included you.",sad
" I want you now, Annie.",xxx
" Annie, Annie, I'm going to make you a fortune.",hap
 Fine.,neu
 What flashlight?,xxx
 It's not yours.,ang
" It's ours.  It's mine, too.",ang
 You kept saying my flashlight as if it's somehow just yours.  How is that supposed to make me feel?,ang
 Yes.,ang
 I'm cold.,xxx
 It's after eleven; let's go home.,ang
 There is no point in coming down here.,ang
 That's my point.,fru
 So let's go home.,ang
 Not particularly.,fru
 I just don't.  It's stupid.,ang
" Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around and then they swim away.  And then they die.",ang
 What are you so excited about?,neu
 This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats.,fru
 I'm just not.,fru
 Yes.,ang
" Last year, you will also remember, our shoes got wet.  I got sand in my panties.  We got into a big fight over nothing.  You got a sore throat and we did not see the grunions.",ang
 We didn't see them the first time either.,fru
 That's the wind.,fru
 About what?,fru
" What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  This is great, isn't it?  Look at this night we've got here; couldn't be better.",xxx
" Actually, I wanted to go a little farther up the coast, get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it.  How you doing?",exc
" Is that, is that - is that just foam?  I can't even tell.  Although, if you can't tell, it's probably isn't them.  It'll probably be unmistakable, don't you think?",exc
" How you doing?  Oh, no, you know what I did?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I should have brought my flashlight.",exc
" The flashlight; the silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?",xxx
 Whose is it?,neu
" Well, sure.",fru
" No, of course, our flashlight; yours and mine.  Me flashlight es su flashlight, naturally.  How could we not think to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out.",xxx
" I wonder, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year.  Remember?",exc
" Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.",neu
" Oh, man.  This is great.  I didn't even think to bring a six pack.  Six pack would be just the ticket right about now.  I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.  Oh.",xxx
 I wonder if they can hear me talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around.,xxx
 You want my jacket?,neu
 Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home?,fru
 Right.,neu
" That's my point, too.",neu
" No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is is that there's no point in coming down here if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?",fru
 Why not?,xxx
" Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.  Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.",exc
" Yeah, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  I mean, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating, something like that.",fru
 There's mystery here and magic.,exc
" Oh, it's a big night for these guys.  Uh, life's last orgy.",exc
" Yeah, they do. Okay.  But it's fish who do something none of the other fish do; like the swallows are returning to Capistrano; or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.",exc
 There's mystery here and magic; a little bit of the unexplainable.  I don't see how you can not be interested.,exc
 For real?,sur
" I don't get it.  First time we came here to see it, you said it was the best night of your life.  And last year, I remember distinctly you were so excited to get here, you stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn't even notice until we were in the car.",xxx
 We weren't in a good spot.,xxx
 We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  I've got good instincts for these things.  Look there.  What's that?  Is that -,xxx
" no, it's just seaweed, isn't it?  Oh, man, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean, think about this.  I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute.",exc
 Out there someplace is this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.  No one sent them an invitation or a map;,exc
" just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one, they turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.",exc
 They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.  It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.,exc
" They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask a question.  They just turn, as one, and start the swim that brings them here; to this place, where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.  Oh, man, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up.",exc
 Well so what did you think?,exc
" Look at this, goose bumps.",neu
 About what?,xxx
 It's ridiculous.,xxx
 It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach.,xxx
 Sure.  They're all told the same story.  It's what keeps us coming back for more; keeps us excited; keeps us thinking that life is going to start any minute now if we could just find the right spot; get in on the action.,xxx
" Well, I'm sorry, but it's still just fish to me.",xxx
" Goddamn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting.",ang
 We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.,ang
" For heaven's sake, we are not going to see the grunions.",xxx
" We never do, do we?  Have we ever?",ang
 Twice is every time we've tried.  That's ever.,fru
" No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus.  I feel as though my entire life is going to be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up.  And the fish won't show up.",xxx
 You don't have any idea what I'm saying.,fru
" I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking this time will be the time, but it never is.",ang
" For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.",xxx
 Do you remember the first time we came to see it?,xxx
" It was about four years ago, right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes and you popped the cork.",sad
" And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me, right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them.  And I remember thinking this is it.  At last, at last I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.",xxx
 Dancing barefoot in the sand; drinking champagne from the bottle.,sad
 I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.,sad
 No.,sad
 No.,sad
 No.,fru
 No.,fru
 No.,fru
 No.,ang
 I want something to turn out the way it's supposed to.,ang
 This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.,ang
" Oh, right, sure.  This is standing on the beach.   This is waiting.  This is fighting.",ang
 But this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.,ang
" This is just this.  I mean, it includes a lot and everything, but it's just not, you know, something else.  Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?",xxx
" I know you are, Augie.  Really, I do.  I know you meant for this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and everything.  But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.",fru
 I didn't say that.,sad
" For heaven's sake, whatever I'm doing, I'd rather be doing it with you.",xxx
 Well don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?  You're the one who probably wishes you were with somebody else; somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.,xxx
" Okay, fine.  So we're in the wrong spot, but we're with the right person.",hap
" Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty on the water, doesn't it?  Big ol' white moon.  I'm sorry, Augie.",hap
 Or not.,xxx
 Well so what'd you think?,neu
 What I said.,neu
 Certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,fru
 I'm not the only one.  Look at these people.,xxx
 Are we talking about the same thing?,xxx
" Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this the wrong way, but are you having your period?",fru
 Well what's bugging you?,ang
" There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do their little fish business.  We go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home.",ang
 Why not?,xxx
 We've missed them twice.,xxx
 That's not ever.,xxx
 We'll see them this year.,fru
 I thought you wanted to see them.,xxx
" No, of course, not.",fru
 It's just fish; nothing to get traumatized over.,fru
" I've been trying to work this backwards, but I can't seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse.",fru
" You were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.  Let's see, I took a shower.  Uh, you watched the news.  You said the grunions are running tonight.  I said great, let's go.  I feel lucky tonight.",fru
" Uh,okay.  So I'm putting on my jacket; putting out the animals;",fru
" uh, taking the car out of the gara- out of the garage.",fru
 Uh.,fru
" Wait a minute, I've got it.",neu
" It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker?  You said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?  That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time.  That's it.  Of course.",neu
 Sure.  Okay.  Alright.  I've got it.  Listen do you want to dance?,xxx
 You want to get some champagne?,xxx
" What, you want me to breathe in your ear?",fru
 You want to get married again?,fru
" What, you want a divorce?",fru
 A vacation?,fru
" A new carpet?  A poodle?  An ice cream?  A back rub?  A suicide pact?  What?  What, Carla?  What the hell do you want?",xxx
" Well welcome to the human race.  You think this is what I had in mind?  You think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line, we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?  No.",ang
" No, I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and wind in our hair and sand in our toes and the fish will always come and the bills will always pay themselves.",xxx
" And we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us, 'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.",ang
" Yes, it is.",fru
 Right.,fru
" No, I know, me neither.",ang
 I'm doing the best I can.,fru
" Maybe if you were with somebody else, too, huh?",xxx
" No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy.",sad
 Yeah?,sur
" Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.",hap
" I don't know.  It seemed like a good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you've got of the moon from here.",hap
" Shh.  If we're very quiet, the fish might come.",hap
 Or not.,xxx
 Do you think it's them?,xxx
" Nobody knows we're here, except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.",fea
 What are we to do?,fea
 Now and always sweet.,xxx
 It was bound to come sooner or later.,xxx
" Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.",exc
 Behave exquisitely.,exc
 Certainly.  I shall probably do a court curtsey.,exc
 But what's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.,exc
 It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.,exc
" Yes, meaning just that.",xxx
 Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.,xxx
 Who's they?,exc
" If I laugh at everything, I must laugh at us, too.",neu
" How long will it last, this ludicrous and overbearing love of ours?",exc
 Shall we always want to bicker and fight?,exc
" Oh, dear.  Should we like that.",xxx
" What happens if one of us dies?  Does the one that's left, still laugh?",exc
" Well that's serious enough, isn't it?",exc
" Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.",xxx
" Elliot, worms don't pop.",xxx
" Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you, except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I will kill you.",exc
 Which particular one?,exc
" Oh, Charles; that was his name, Charles.  Oh, he did wriggle so beautifully.",exc
 I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.,exc
 It went on intermittently for days.,exc
" It burnt my comb, too, and all the towels in the bathroom.",exc
 That was the first time you ever hit me.,exc
" The manager came in and found is rolling about on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.  Oh, dear.",exc
" How ridiculous. How utterly, utterly ridiculous.",exc
 And very much sillier.,exc
 Good God.,fea
 I wonder.,fea
" It must be them, then.",fea
" We'll be alright, darling.  Whatever happens, aren't we?",neu
" I don't care, then.",exc
" Hello, hello.  What?  Wrong number.",xxx
 What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?,exc
 With the mo- with the most perfect poise?,exc
" Ah.  Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter when one's happy, do they?",xxx
" Don't say that, darling.",xxx
" Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?",neu
" What does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?",xxx
" You mustn't be serious, my dear.  That's just what they want.",neu
 All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid- acid in their damn sweetness and light.,ang
 Certainly you must.  We're figures of fun alright.,xxx
 Who knows.,xxx
 No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.,sad
 It all depends on how well we've played.,xxx
" Yes.  Yes, with all his might.",xxx
" No, no, it isn't.  Death's very laughable; such a cunning little mystery, all done with mirrors.",xxx
" So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and- and enjoy the party as much as we can, like very small, quite idiotic little school children.",xxx
" Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.",exc
" I don't mind what you do, see?  You can paint yourself bright green all over and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best.",xxx
 Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,xxx
 The one when you bought that little painted wooded snake and put it on my bed?,xxx
 Horrible thing.  I hated it.,ang
 How long did that row last?,xxx
 The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown.,xxx
 Line?,neu
 How -- that was a rouser wasn't it?,exc
 I didn't hit you very hard.,xxx
" Ah, I shall never forget his face.",xxx
 Yes.  We were very much younger then.,xxx
" As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",neu
 That was the first time you ever hit me.,ang
" The manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.  Oh, dear.",hap
" How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.",hap
 And very much sillier.,hap
 You knew there was nothing in that.,xxx
 Presents?  A trivial little brooch.,xxx
 Not at all.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often.,exc
 I did not.  You made the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.,xxx
" Just a little, perhaps, nothing serious.",hap
 Let him kiss you.,neu
 What of it?,ang
 It gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.,xxx
" If you hadn't been so nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.",fru
" Oh, dear.  I'm bored with this conversation.",fru
" No, thanks.",ang
 I don't see why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.,fru
 It seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.,fru
 It's become a habit with you.,ang
" Oh, don't be so stupid.",fru
 What?,ang
" No, just making myself fascinating for you",fru
" The woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute, will you?",xxx
" Oh, no, it isn't.",ang
" Oh, be quiet.",ang
 It's a pity you didn't- It's a pity you didn't have more brandy.,neu
 It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.,fru
" Adders don't snap, they sting.",ang
 They sting.,fru
 I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops.,ang
" Yes, I did, quite a lot.",ang
 Mind your own business.,ang
 You're quite insufferable.  I expected it's because you're drunk.,ang
 You always had a weak head.,ang
" On the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",ang
" Oh, shut up.",ang
" Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.",ang
 Why?,ang
 There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.,ang
 They're away in Tunis.,xxx
" Turn it on again, please.",ang
" Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.",ang
 Go away.  Go away.  I hate you.,ang
 You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.,ang
 We swapped. Listen.,neu
" Listen, indeed.  I am sick and tired of listening to you, you damn sadistic bully.",ang
 Stop.,ang
 Stop.  I hate you.  Do you hear me? You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.,ang
" This is the end.  Do you understand, the end?  Finally and forever.",ang
" Oh, yes, I am.",ang
" Let go of me.  You're a cruel fiend and I hate and loath you.  Thank God, I discovered in time what you're really like.",ang
 Marry you again? Huh.,ang
" Never, never, never.  I'd rather die in torment. Beast brute.",ang
 Swine.,ang
" That was a rouser, wasn't it?",xxx
 I didn't hit you very hard.,neu
 I shall never forget his face.,xxx
 We were very much younger then.,xxx
" As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",fru
 I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.,fru
" I remember it well, bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.",xxx
 You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,fru
" You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?",ang
 Line?,neu
 You let him kiss you.  You said you did.,ang
 What of it?,ang
 What about me?,ang
" That's a nice point of view, I must say.",ang
 So am I; bored stiff.,ang
 You want some brandy?,xxx
" I'll have a little myself, I think.",fru
" No particular reason.  Anyhow, they were very small ones.",fru
 You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.,fru
 You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any at the moment.,fru
" Really, Amanda",ang
 Nothing.,ang
" Going out somewhere, my dear?",ang
 Oh.  That reply has broken my heart.,fru
" As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.",ang
" Yes, it is.",ang
 Line?,neu
 It's a pity you didn't have any more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.,ang
 Line?,neu
" Snap.  Oh, snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.",ang
" They -- nonsense, they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.",ang
 They snap.,ang
 Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,xxx
" I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then, hmm?",ang
 You must have had a riotous time.,ang
" No restraint at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyhow.",ang
 I'm not in the least drunk.,ang
 I think I mentioned once before that I've only had three minute liquor glasses of brandy this whole evening.  That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk.,fru
 Very interesting.  And how about a child of four and a child of six and a child of nine?,ang
" We might get up a splendid little- a splendid little debate about this, you know, intemperate tots.",xxx
 Very good idea.  I will,ang
 You better turn that off I think.,ang
 It's late and the people upstairs will get annoyed.,xxx
" There are people downstairs, I suppose",ang
 This is no time of year for Tunis.,xxx
 I will do no such thing.,xxx
 Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.,ang
 Turn it off.,ang
 Listen--,ang
" You're a vile tempered, loosed living",ang
 wicked little beast. And I- I hope I never see you again as long as live.,ang
 You're not going like this.,ang

 And how long is that going to take?,fru
 I don't-,fru
" I don't have time for this today, and-",fru
" Is there anything you can do?  Please, have some compassion.  Is there something you can do?",fru
" Please, I don't think that's necessary.  I'm just asking, maybe you could call over and say that somebody miss informed her because I didn't pick to stand in this line.  I asked them where to stand, and they told me here.",fru
" No, they did.  The lady over there told me to stand in this line and I've been here for an hour.",fru
 No.,fru
" No, I'm not, I'm sorry.I'm not stupid.",fru
 Isn't there anything you can do?  Just call over and ask them if I can go to the front of the line in the other line.,ang
 Why not?,ang
" Except they're going tell, are you going to tell me the right line to stand in this time at least?",fru

" There's nothing I can do for you, ma'am.",fru
" But, obviously I don't have time for you to stand here and waste my time in this line.  There are other people who need service behind you who are waiting for the right things.",fru
" I am a very compassionate person, and I'm offended that you imply that I'm not.  Of course, I'm compassionate.  Look, I work in the D.M.V..  What do you think I am?  Go wait in line two A.",fru
 Don't ask me to have somebody else come over here and move you myself.  I can't come back over there.  I'll get security if you need me to.,fru

 How did you get a job?  What am I - What am I supposed to do?,fru
" I mean, I just don't--I don't know.  If you don't have a lot of qualification, where do you - where do you find work?  It's like L.A. is so frustrating because if you don't know somebody, you can't -you can't get a job.  It's impossible.  It's totally discriminatory.  You have to know somebody.",fru
 It's not fair.,fru
 That's fine.  I'd be willing to start anywhere.  I can't get a job.,fru

 This is humiliating.,fru
" No, I don't I don't want to accept that.  I think that's bullshit.",fru
 I don't know.  I feel like I've tried everything.,fru
 Three years of going out every day--every day--and looking for a job and being constantly denied everywhere I go.,fru
 I'm just so scared to start over I mean.  I put so much time and energy into being here.,sad
" Where am I supposed to go?  I mean, like what?",sad
 I don't know. Maybe I can take out a loan. I just- I need prospects and I don't feel like I have any.,sad

" I wish I had some answers for you, babe.  I mean-I don't know what to tell you.",fru
 I went to school and I got my degree.  And I got a job.,neu
 Nothing's impossible.,neu
 You have to be willing - You have to be willing to start you know at the bottom and work your way up. and,neu
 I,fru
" No, it doesn't pay the bills, but it would pay something.  And it would help you get somewhere else.",neu
" and No, I understand, but you've got to start somewhere.  It's better than nothing and that's all you have.  You have nothing right now.",neu
" Wait, You can move up.  There's management programs in McDonalds and things like that.",neu
" [GARBAGE] No, I wouldn't, but I--",neu

 Have you?  There's got to be something else.,neu
" I don't know what to tell you, babe. Maybe- Maybe you're right.  Maybe you do have to go someplace else.  I don't know, maybe it's just not meant to be here.  I mean I want you to-I don't want you to give up, but I mean I don't want you to move away, but at the same time, I don't like seeing you like this.",fru
" If it's rent or something like that, I mean I can help you out a little bit, if- if that will help you you know stick with it.",neu
" Well, just don't give up. And there's- you know, You never know, something might be around the corner tomorrow.",neu
" Well, you know I'm not going to let you starve.",neu
" Of course, you're worried.  We're all worried.  I'm worried for you.  Everyone's always worried.  You know, I don't-maybe I have a job and yeah, it's a good job whatever and I'm happy, but it doesn't mean I'm going to have it tomorrow or the next day.  You never know what's going to happen.  Something crazy could happen tomorrow.	Something crazy can happen for you tomorrow and you'll get a job.  You never know.  You can walk up to somebody on the street and it'll be something great.  You've just got to be positive.  You're so negative all the time.",xxx
" I understand, but you know what, you've been negative for three years.",fru
" It's the way it seems to me.  You started complaining about not being able to find a job the first day you went out and didn't find a job.  And I'm not saying like and not trying to you know put you down or anything, it's just that-",neu
" But it's true, babe.  You've got to be more positive about things.  Like- Have some faith in yourself.",fru
" Well, exactly.  Money is not everything.",neu
 You can.,fru
 You know I would never let that happen.  I wouldn't let that happen.,neu
" You can always stay with me if you- if you have to stay with me for a while and get yourself back up on your feet again.  You know I'm not just going to you know just throw you to the wolves or something like that.  If there's any way I can help you, I will.",neu
 But you have to keep trying.  You can't give up.,neu
" And you've got to think--well, ask yourself why are they not hiring you?",neu
 I mean are you going in for interviews?,neu
 Are you presenting-,neu
 putting your best foot forward? or you,neu
" Do they seem to like you? I mean, Can you get any read from them?",neu
 Have you ever called them back and asked why you didn't get the job?,neu
 Do they give you any specifics as to why they didn't go with you?,neu
" Yeah, I understand. maybe What jobs are we talking about?",neu
 Like- What's your ideal job?  What do you want to do?,neu
 Of course.,neu
" Everyone wants to be a working actor, but they all work at something else.",neu
 So what's the something else?,neu
" You can't get a catering gig?  Well, I can call some friends.  I- Well, I did call some friends before, but you went in once and then never went back.",neu
 If I- If you- Will you stick with it?,neu
" Okay.  Okay, I'll call some people.",neu
" But you've got to keep looking for other stuff. You've got to do it on your own, too.  Okay?",neu
 You know I'll always help you.,neu
" Hi,um- I think my baggage was lost, and I need to I guess file a claim or I don't know what.",neu
 Um-Seventeen. Coming from --,neu
 It was Virgin Atlantic coming from London.,neu
" Yeah, I don't know where it was lost.  I was coming from Africa, so.",fru
 Right.,neu
 Yeah.,neu
 That's good.,neu
" Well, I can't leave without it. I mean, Could you find out?",neu
" Right, well can you get on the computer maybe and like track it down and see when it's going to get here?",fru
" Yes, sir, I know what my bag looks like.",fru
 Um- It's a travel backpack.  It's green and gray.  It's got my name on it and my information.,neu
" No, it didn't turn up at the baggage claim.",fru
 I mean we've gone through all of this.  I've been to five people already who--,fru
 Okay.,fru
" Yes, lots of really like -- sentimental value only, but--",fru
 --really important stuff.,xxx
" That's not going to cut it. Like, Really, I really need to get this bag back.",xxx
 Does this happen often?  Do they--you just lose baggage and you just offer people money for it?,fru
 Uh- Not lose the baggage in the first place. I mean You're offering a service here. I paid so much money for that ticket.,ang
" No, but I mean like why can't- why can't you find it?  Where did it go?  Who lost it?",ang
" Well, I just-I paid so much money for this ticket.  I feel like you guys should be able to get-to offer me more than a fifty dollar voucher.",ang
" Yeah, meaning I didn't die in a fiery plane crash.  How convenient, but um- I paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline, and I would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place.",ang
" Right, but part of the agreement is that I'm paying so that I can take myself and my belongings with me.",ang
 And that you're going to transport them safely from one place to another.,ang
" That's all you can offer me? I mean, my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar.",ang
 No.,xxx
 Why do I need flight insurance?  Why don't you guys just guarantee that you're going to get the stuff that I leave with to my destination?,fru
" Right, but if I'm riding a bus, I don't need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack I take on is going to get to my destination with me.",fru
 Because they made me check it.  It's too heavy.,fru
" So I would have carried it on, but they made me check it and then they lost it.",xxx
 There's nothing else you can do?,fru
 I don't believe that for a second.,ang
" No, I don't think you are. I mean If you were doing everything you could, you'd either give me more money or you'd figure out where my bag is.",xxx
 What do you mean as you can?  Who makes up these rules?,ang
 You're an autono- autonomous human being.  You could- You could go into the com-,ang
 You could go into the computer and- you know- print-,xxx
" So I'm just supposed to oh, well, oops, my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher?",fru
 And you have no guarantee.,fru
 This is ridiculous.,fru
" Uh- Because you guys lost it, so it should be your responsibility to find it, too.",fru
" Oh, come on.  Would you cut it out?  This is ridiculous.",fru
" No, I don't think I am.  I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me, and I brought it you know from Africa.  It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want.",ang
 It's not like I can go to Kmart and buy another.,ang
 okay fine.,xxx
" Yeah, I'll take your fifty dollar voucher.",fru
 Thanks.,fru
" Okay, what flight were you on?",neu
 On what airline?,neu
" From London, okay. Um- And you went through all your proper checkpoints?",neu
 So you haven't seen your bags since Africa. You flew threw Heath Row to here.,neu
" Okay.  Well, let me see here. I-",neu
 It seems like it went through Heath Row.  I see it here. uh-,neu
 But uh- I don't see it here in the airport yet. uh,neu
 I'm not sure where it is.  We can absolutely keep an eye out for for it for you.,neu
" Well, I'm not a miracle worker.  I don't know what I can do for you.  I don't have the bag right here.",neu
" Well, as I told you, it left Heath Row and it seems to have arrived here.  But if you can't find it, then-are you sure you know what your bag looks like?",neu
" Okay, and what is that?  What kind of bag is it?",neu
 And you couldn't find it?,fru
 Are you sure?,neu
" Well, obviously, that wasn't me, so I'm going to have to ask you the same questions they asked you just so we can get to the same point.",fru
" All right?  Now, um- it's green, travel bag, you couldn't find it.  And was there something important in it that you need it?",neu
 Sentimental value.,neu
" Right.  Well, I don't know what to tell you. Um- What I can offer you is a fifty dollar voucher on your next flight.",neu
" No, I understand. I mean. It's got to be tough all those sentimental things, but um- this is all I can do for you.",neu
" Well, you know, sometimes that's--really, I mean what else could we do?",neu
" Well,",neu
 Obviously ma'am.,fru
" I am sorry, ma'am.",fru
" Let's- Let's just relax for a moment, ma'am.  You understand, obviously, we're going to do everything we can to keep all of your luggage here.",neu
" Obviously, we're not trying to lose your luggage.  Do you really believe that we're trying to lose your luggage ma'am?",neu
" Well, if I knew that, then I'd know where it was, wouldn't I?",xxx
" Well, we're talking about one bag.  You personally made it here, didn't you?",neu
 That's what the cost of the ticket was for.,fru
" Ma'am, international flights are not cheap and there's many reasons for that.  It does not have solely to do with your baggage or-",fru
" Right. Yes, ma'am.",fru
" Right, and also if you'll read the fine print of your agreement you'll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage, it is a fifty dollar voucher.",fru
" Well, I understand that.  Did you buy flight insurance?",neu
" Well, my hands are really tied then.",neu
" Well, it's like any kind of insurance.  You don't-when you get it, then you get more. You know, Like if you--",neu
" Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important?",neu
" Uh, so it was really heavy.",neu
" Well, you know what, it could still turn up, but until then I can offer you this fifty dollar voucher.",fru
" I'm sorry, ma'am, there's nothing else I can do.  My hands are really tied here.  I really wish there was something else I could do for you.",neu
 Well I don't know why you wouldn't believe that.,neu
" Obviously, I'm doing everything that I can here.",fru
" Well, I have no way to give you more money.  I'm giving you as much money as I can, and figuring- as far as figuring out where you bag is-",neu
 makes up?,neu
" The airline makes these rules, mom ma'am.",neu
 I've gone into the computer.  I told you exactly what I can see in the computer that your luggage did arrive here.,xxx
" Well, you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up. And if it does, then we'll deliver it to you.",fru
" I have no guarantee, absolutely not.",fru
 How can I guarantee finding your luggage when it's lost?,fru
" Right, well, when you're at home and you lose something, do you guarantee that you're going to find it later on?",fru
" Well, it sounds to me like you're being ridiculous",fru
 Right.,neu
" I understand that, ma'am, but things get lost.  There's nothing I can do about that.  Things happen.  Accidents happen.",fru
" And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now, obviously I can't do that.",neu
 So you'd like the fifty dollar voucher?,neu
" Okay, just fill out these three forms, and um- you'll- we'll have that sent to you within the next three weeks and, of course, we'll definitely keep an eye out for your bag.",neu
 You have a wonderful day.,neu
 A good friend of mine passed away the other day.,sad
" Oh they had some pretty progressive cancer,",sad
" metastasized and it was old and they knew that it wasn't looking good, but-",sad
 Yeah.  We were.  Pretty close.,sad
 [BREATHING],sad
 Kind of.,sad
" It's hard to watch when it's painful for them, you know.",sad
" I just, I don't know.",sad
 I know.,sad
 And he could of...  He was pretty awesome,sad
" Uh,  We grew up together.",sad
" Yeah, he kind of did a lot of things, but we acted together, sometimes.",sad
" I feel really bad for his family, you know.",sad
" It must be really, really hard to lose a child.",sad
" Yeah.  And they were really supportive, like through the whole process, but-",sad
 [BREATHING],sad
 I can't imagine what his- what his parents are going through.,sad
" Yeah, I'm just going to miss him.",sad
 Thank you.,sad
" Yeah, they're going to do some sort of memorial service or something.",sad
 Thanks.,sad
" It's really bizarre, you know, when you know somebody really well, and then...",sad
 something happens and they die and it's like-,sad
" really hard to imagine that like you're going to continue to live, and that person's just going to have stopped.",sad
 [BREATHING],sad
 yeah.,sad
 It's hard to say good-bye.,sad
 [BREATHING],sad
 [LAUGHTER],xxx

" Oh no, I'm so sorry. What happened?",sad
 That's the worst.  I'm so sorry.  Did you know him well?,sad
" I am so sorry,  It's-",sad
 It's the worst when they go like that. [GARBAGE] Was he young?,sad
" Absolutely, absolutely.",sad
 It's the think,sad
 There's no reason for it.,sad
 Yeah?  What'd he do?  What did they do?  How'd you know him?,sad
 yeah.,sad
" Is he an actor too, or-?",neu
" Yes of course, of course.",sad
 Was he very close to his family?,neu
 yeah.,neu
 Of course not.  You have no idea what it's like to lose a kid.,sad
" Of course. If there's anything I can do, you just let me know.  Okay?",xxx
 Of course.,xxx
 Is there a funeral planned? or-,neu
" Cool, Well, If you want me to go with you, I will.",neu
 No problem.,neu
" Right, it just doesn't make any sense, it's not real.  It doesn't feel real.",sad
 yeah.,neu
" Do you know what, it's going to pass,eventually, I mean it'll never pass, it'll always be there, and you'll always remember and everything like that, but you know.  It'll get easier I guess.",neu
 That's the best way to put it.,neu
 Absolutely.,neu
" Do you know what, if it was me that died, I'd really want you to be crying and being really upset too any way. So, I think you should definitely do this, because it's trying what it's supposed to be.",neu
 So guess what.,exc
 I got into college.,exc
 U.S.C..,exc
 yeah.,exc
 No.,exc
 I'll stay in town.,exc
 Uh- I don't know.,hap
" Well, I don't want to, I don't want to live with my mom.",neu

 So should we get a place near campus? or-,exc

 It's going to be ridiculous.  It's going to be so cool.,exc
 I'm not going to make fun of you.,xxx
" [LAUGHTER] Oh, I'm going to be working too, I mean.",exc
 I- I hear the same.,exc
" I don't know how I feel about that, but-",exc
 oh yeah.,exc
 oh yeah.,exc
" [LAUGHTER] Oh, it'll be awesome, that's for sure.",exc
 Better than if I'd picked up and moved to Boston.,exc
 [LAUGHTER] by yourself.,exc
 you'd be that kid,exc
" living near campus, and not going to school.",exc
 [LAUGHTER],exc
 yeah.,exc
 We should go apartment shop-er-hunting.,exc
 Let's go tomorrow.,exc

 Uh! stay over here.  Like travel to school. because you are so close to me,exc
" Okay, you're right, you're right, you're right,  right.  Maybe we should get a place together.",hap
 That'll be awesome.,exc
" I don't know.  Well.  I wouldn't mind living by the U.S.C. campus, you know, but I'm not going to go to school right now, so.",exc
 I know.,xxx
 But I'd love to go all the US- all the U.S.C. parties and do all that crazy stuff with you.,exc
 it is going to be so much fun. Yes.,exc
 Uh! I'm so happy that you're not going to go away.,exc
" Oh, I bet you're going to love it too.  You always wanted to go to U.S.C..",exc
" You're going to have so much fun.  And there's lo- tons of people, you're going to meet so many people, I'm going to meet so many people too, because we're going to be there together.",exc
" Sure, why not.  I don't know why not, I'm not doing anything I have no plans, I could live anywhere I want.",exc
 That'll be great. That'll be great.,exc
" We should try to find, like, a party spot though, like you know where there's going to be a lot of parties, where there are cool people, though.  Do you know any people that might be out there?",exc
" Yeah, me either.",exc
" [garbage] I know, I know, I know, we'll figure it out.  Right?  [garbage] it is going to be so much fun.",exc
" You can't make fun of me because I'm not going to school, though, because I'm going to be working though.",exc
 I'll have to make money and support us.,xxx
" Well, yeah, of course, but you're going to be working on your school stuff too, and partying that takes up a lot of time, right, especially at U.S.C., I hear it's a big party college.",xxx
 Woo- I I do.,exc
 I know exactly how you feel about that. I think you feel really excited about it.  I know you are. I can tell. I know you.,exc
 You're a wild and crazy woman.,exc
" Uh huh, it will be awesome.",exc
" Oh, man, I'd have been so mad at you.  I'd have been so mad at you, because, what could I have done,",xxx
" living near the U.S.C. campus by myself, not going to school there. just really pathetic and sad.",exc
" Exactly.  Mooching off of all like the college experiences, that would've been me but you have saved me from that disaster. Thank you. Thank you very much.",exc
" Oh, it's going to be so much fun.",exc
" Well, congratulations. and to me too, because now I get to-have-",exc
 That's a good idea.,exc
" Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow-",exc
" Good.  We'll have to have one soon, you're going to have to go to school in a couple of months.",exc
" Oh God, it's awesome... There's going to be tons of places. [garbage]",exc
" Hi, sir.  How can I help you?",neu
 Okay.,neu
" [LAUGHTER] All right.  I'm sorry, sir that you've been having a hard time.",neu
" I kwon, it is ridiculous",neu

 Uh- when's when's-,neu
 Sir-,fru
" If yeah, well if you just slow down we'll um, we'll definitely have your problem solved and after we have your problem solved, then I can transfer you to a manager, someone who can you know, you can voice your complaint to, who will be able to something about it.",neu
" Okay, so where?, okay, all right, so where did you uh- locate your your bill?",neu
 In the mail?,neu
" So is it, is- is it at all possible that maybe this statement is just old and that the transaction hadn't been processed yet?",neu
 Okay.,neu
 Okay.,neu
 All right. I-,xxx
" Okay so, I'll just look it up and you know see what's going on, maybe we can...",neu
 if I call it up on the screen.,neu
" So in the database, it looks as though um, there is a there is like a glitch in the transaction where it hadn't gone through before, but I do see that you paid the, what can you tell me the amount, what was the amount?",neu
" Okay, I do see that on here, and it says that um, it had some trouble clearing for some reason.  And I think that was the problem on our end.  So um-",neu
" Well you know sometimes-- just with online transactions, things happens. so um-",neu
" Yeah, we- Somebody went in and- and cleared the problem and it looks like you're all paid.",neu
" You do the direct the direct it um- it's taking right out of your bank account, correct?",neu
 Yeah so- That --that did go through.,neu
" Um- I can try to do that for you, certainly.",neu
" Right, right, and since--yeah, since it was just a computer glitch, then that's that should be cleared up as well.  So I'm going to go ahead and try and put that into the computer.  And if for some reason you notice on your statement in a few days that you've been charged and an overdue fee, then you should just call back and we'll have that.",neu
 Well I'll give you my direct line and my number so you can- you can  get directly to me.,neu
 yeah.,neu
 No problem.,neu
 ahh one eight hundred three two three,neu
 six four nine four,neu
 You're welcome,neu
 I'm sorry that it was an inconvenience.,neu
 I am glad.,xxx
 Have a good day.,neu
 bye bye,neu
" Oh, thank God.  Do you know how long I've been on the phone for half an hour trying to talk to a freaking human being.",fru
" All I want to do is put my, pay for my freaking credit card, and there's something wrong in my bill, Like I swear, it says I didn't paid last month, but I know I paid last month.",fru
" I put- I've been typing my number in millions of times, it won't listen to me, it's not working, and I can't get a single human being, and finally-",fru
" you are a real human being.  Thank you very, very much.",xxx
" This is ridiculous.  I- I seriously, I don't understand why you think these automated systems are supposed to like work for anybody.  They have never, ever work for me.",ang
" Can you like talk to somebody about this, can you like can you tell them that this is ridiculous and can they change it from now on, is there a phone number you have that I can call that will like automatically be talking to somebody a human being.",ang
" Well, okay ,well First off, fine, fine, fine.  Let's see, first off, um- yeah my bill's wrong.",fru
" Like I know I paid last month, but it hasn't been paid and you charged me a late fee.",ang
 I got it in the mail.,fru
 yeah,fru
" Well, when I look online, it says, it says that I was charged a late fee so I'm assuming that I paid on your web site-",fru
" like I paid right through your own company before my due date but it's still and it even shows my payment there, and then it charged me the late fee afterwards.",fru
 Okay.,fru
" Okay, great, go ahead.",neu
 It was one ninety eight sixty three. I paid the minimum.,fru
 Wow.  I can't believe you're actually admitting to having a problem on your end.  That's a first.,xxx
" No, No, No, I am grateful.",neu
 Absolutely.,xxx
 Did they take-,neu
" Yes, yes, exactly.",neu
 Are you taking the late fee off of my account then?,neu
 Because I paid it on time.,fru
 Right.,neu
" Yeah, but if I call back, I'll have to go through this whole rigmarole again. and try to get a hole or someone.",fru
 Really?,sur
" That would be wonderful, that would be great seriously.",hap
" thank you, what's the number?",hap
 three two three,neu
" six four nine four. That would be so great, thank you so much.",hap
 oh.,xxx
" It was horrible, but you've made it much better, thank you very much. Absolutely",hap
" You too, thank you so much, have a wonderful day.",hap
 bye,xxx
 What's he going to say? Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.,sad
 How could he see it?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed.,xxx
 When?,xxx
 What was he doing out here at four in the morning?,xxx
 Did you talk to him?,sad
 He cried hard.,sad
 He is thinking about him again.,sad
" It's getting just like after Larry died, he's having dreams, he's walking around at night.",sad
 What's the meaning of that?,sad
 What?,xxx
" What do you mean, dishonest?",xxx
" What are you going to do, argue with him?",xxx
 You can't just say that to him.,xxx
" How are you going to prove it, I mean, there's no body and there's no grave.  So what are you going to do? Do you have proof?",xxx
" To you it is, and to me, but not to your father.  Now look, you can talk yourself  blue in the face, but there's no body, and there's no grave, so where are you?",fru
" The trouble with the god damned newspapers, I mean every week, they do a story about some boy's been gone longer than Larry and he comes back, so the next one is gonna--",xxx
 why?,xxx
 Well I got an idea.  But what's the story?,neu
" Well that's nobody's business but yours, Chris.",xxx
" What- What am - what are you going to do, I mean you're old enough to make up your own mind?",xxx
 Well you're want to make sure your father isn't you know going to--lose them,xxx
 I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.,fru
" As far as your father is concerned, he's not dead and you've no right to take his girl.",xxx
" Now Chris you can go on from there, but I don't know what to do.  I mean do you know what to do, because I don't.",fru
" Well you're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong with that.",neu
 Have you asked Annie yet to marry you?,neu
" Well how did you know that she will go along with it, I mean maybe she feels the same way as your father?",neu
" The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never have",neu
 Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.,neu
" well, that's a good reason, but it doesn't answer a thing.",xxx
" No, I don't want a diagram, but, Chris, your father thinks Larry's coming back.",fru
" You marry his girl, and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't.",sad
 Give it some more thought.,xxx
 What the hell is this?,ang
 Are you crazy?,ang
 Wait a minute.  Tell me this.  Do you mean to say that you would leave the business?,fru
 Must you be inspired?,xxx
" Don't- you, you can't think like that!  Don't think like that!",fru
" All right!  But don't think like that, because I mean, what the hell did we do all this for, Chris?  The whole business it's all for you!  The whole shooting match is for you!",ang
" All right, but don't think like that.",xxx
" I don't understand you, do I?",fru
" Yeah, I can see that.",xxx
 He saw it.,sad
 He was out here when it broke.,sad
" Around Four this morning, and there was a crack and I looked out.  We're standing right there when I cracked.",sad
 I don't know.  but When it cracked he ran back into the house and start to cry in the kitchen.,sad
 No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.,sad
 I could hear him right through the floor of my room.,sad
" I guess, he is.",sad
 I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing mom did.  We made a terrible mistake with dad.,sad
 Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.,sad
" You know that Larry's not coming back, and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?",sad
" No um, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time we realized that nobody else believes that Larry is alive.",fru
" Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk around during the night, looking for him um.  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any for years now?",fru
 We have to say it to him!,fru
" For God's sake, mom, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years!  It's insane!",ang
" Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.",fru
" All right, All right mom.  Listen!",fru
" You know why I asked Annie here, don't you?",sad
 You know.,fru
 I'm going to ask her to marry me.,neu
 You know that's not just my business.,fru
 So it's all right.  I can go ahead with it then?,fru
 Then it's not only my business.  Sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?,xxx
" You know that?  Isn't it your business too, if I tell dad, and he gets, throws a fit about it?   you have such a talent for ignoring things!",xxx
 She's not Larry's girl!,xxx
" I don't know why it is.  But every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer.  My whole bloody life, time after time, after time.",fru
 To hell with that!,ang
 I want to get this settled first.,xxx
" Well, if she does, then that's the end of it, but from her letters it sounds like she's forgotten about it.  I'll find out and then we'll thrash it out with Dad, all right?  Mom, don't avoid me.",xxx
" So what, I'm not fast with women.",fru
 Because it is.,fru
" I can't help it.  I know her best.  I was brought up next door to here, the easiest, when I think of somebody for my wife, I think of Annie.  Do you want a diagram?",fru
" All right, then, Mom.",fru
" I've given it three years of thought.  And hope by now that he wouldn't.  Can you forget about Larry an-- and we can have a regular wedding and have everybody be happy.  But that can't happen here, I'm set to get out.",fru
" I'll get out. I'll get married and live some place else.  Maybe, maybe New York?",fru
" I've been a good son for too long, a big sucker.  I'm through with it.",xxx
 The business?  The business?  It doesn't inspire me?,ang
" Yes!  I like it an hour a day.  If I had to grub for money all day long, I like to come home to something beautiful.  I want a family.  I want- I want kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to. and Annie is in the center of that, and now where do I find it?",xxx
 Then help me stay here.,xxx
 I know that Mom. I know.  Just you help me stay here.,xxx
 I am thinking like that.,xxx
 No.  You don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.,xxx
 Why did you invite her here?,xxx
 She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why all of the sudden?,neu
 Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,xxx
 He's not going to marry her.,xxx
 It's got that about it.,xxx
" What's going on here, Joe?",fru
 She's not his girl.  She knows she's not.,ang
" She's . . . Then why is she still single.  New York is full of men, why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited.",fru
 Because she knows what I know - she's faithful as a rock and my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.,fru
" Nobody in her- this house dares shake her faith.  Strangers might, but not his father, and not his brother.",fru
 I want you to pretend like he's coming back!,ang
" Because if he's not coming back, then I'll kill myself.",ang
" Laugh.  Laugh at me, but what happens the night that she goes to sleep in his bed, and his memorial breaks in pieces?",ang
" Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand alone.",xxx
" Only last week, another boy turned up in Detroit, been missing longer than Larry, you read it yourself.",ang
" You above all, have got to believe, Joe.",xxx
 You've got to believe. You've got to--,sad
 I can't help it!,ang
 Why does that bother you?,neu
 Well maybe.  Maybe she just wanted to see her again.,neu
" What did you mean? He lived next door to the girl all of his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again? Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told you.",neu
 How do you know he is even thinking about it?,fru
" Well, so what.",fru
" Now, listen, Kate, just-",fru
 You can't read her mind.,xxx
 How do you know why she's waited?,fru
 Look.  It's a nice day.  Why are we arguing?,fru
 What do you want me to do? What do you want--,fru
" But, Kate...",fru
 [LAUGHTER],fru
 Calm yourself.,fru
 Calm yourself!,fru
" All right, all right.  Calm yourself.",fru
" Why me, above all?",xxx
 What do you mean me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking!,ang
" What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?",ang
 You're the only one I know who loves his parents.,hap
" No, it's good.",hap
 It's so lovely here.  The air is sweet.,hap
 No.  But I'm not going to stay.,hap
 Well your mother has much as told me to leave.,xxx
" Well, you saw that! And you.  You've been-",xxx
 Well sort of embarrassed soon as I came.,sad
 I figured they would- your mother at least.,xxx
" Well, from her point of view why else would I come?",neu
 I guess this is why I came.,hap
" Chris, I've been ready for a long time.",xxx
 I almost got married two years ago.,xxx
 You started to write me.,xxx
 Every day since.,xxx
 Well I was waiting for you!  I mean I didn't-until then you hadn't written and when you write- when you wrote what did you say?  I mean you sure can be ambiguous Chris.,xxx
 I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait so long?  All this time I've been wondering if I was a fool for thinking of you!,hap
" Not like that, you're not.",hap
" Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  Chris, what's the matter?",hap
" No, what is it, your mother?",xxx
" What is it?  Even in your letters, there is something ashamed.",xxx
 It wouldn't work like this.,sad
 yeah sure.,neu
 how many?,sad
 Oh gee.,sad
 Do you still feel like that?,neu
" Because you can't feel like that anymore Chris, you hear me?  I mean everything that you have, you deserve.  And that includes me.  And your father?  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air, you should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.",sad
 What would I do with a fortune?,hap
 I know.  It's going out of style isn't it?,hap
 So you're not sorry you came?,xxx
 Why?,sur
 Well--,xxx
 What?,neu
 Well the plan was to kind of sneak up on you over a period of a week or so.  But uh- they take it for granted that we're all set.,hap
 How did you know?,neu
" Well, would you want to?  I guess you know this is why I asked you to come.",xxx
" Anne, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you!",hap
" I- I -I have no imagination, that's all I know what to say, I-I'm embarrassing you. I I didn't want to tell you here.  I wanted it to be some place different, some place where we could be new to each other you know.",exc
" You feel it's wrong here, don't you- this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me Annie.  I don't want to win you away from anything.",exc
" Then, he's gone forever-you're sure?",xxx
 Why didn't you?,xxx
 You felt something that far back?,xxx
" Annie, why didn't you say something to me?",xxx
" Give me a kiss, Ann. Give me a-",xxx
 Oh God- I kissed Annie! I can't believe I kissed Annie!  How long I've wanted to do this.,exc
" Oh Annie, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.",exc
 I kissed you.,xxx
 Let's Let's drive someplace.  I- I want to be alone with you.,xxx
" No, nothing like that.",xxx
" Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.",sad
 I don't know how to start.,xxx
" It's- It's mixed up with so many other things, I-",sad
 Remember when I was overseas?  I was in command of the company.,sad
 Yeah.  I lost them.,sad
 just about all.,sad
 Takes a little time to toss something like that off you know because they weren't just men-,sad
" for instance, there's this one time.  It had been raining for several days.  And this kid came up to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks. you know, He just put them in my pocket.",sad
" I know that- that's not a big thing, but it's just the kind of guys I had. They didn't die. They- They killed themselves for each other.",sad
 I mean that exactly that-a little more selfish and they would have still been here today.,sad
" And I got an ideal, watching them all go down.  Everything was being destroyed see and-",sad
" but it seemed to me that something new was being created at the same time, a kind of responsibility, man for man.  Do you understand me?",sad
 And to show that-to-to bring that back onto the earth again like a- like a monument.  And everyone would have it standing behind them and- and it would make a difference for them.,sad
 And then I went home and it was incredible.  It had no meaning here.,sad
" It was all like some kind of bus accident to them.  I went back to work with my dad, in that whole rat race again.",sad
 And I felt what you said- ashamed somehow-because nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a whole lot of guys. and,sad
" It felt wrong to be alive-to open that bank-book; to buy that new car; to look at that new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take those things out of the war, but if you drive that car, you have to know that that comes from the love that a man has for a man.  And you've got to be a little bit better than that!",sad
" And if you're not, then it's all just loot and it's got blood on it, and I don't want any of it!  And, I guess that included you.",xxx
" I I want you now, Annie.",exc
" Oh Annie.  Annie, I am going to make you a fortune!",hap
 Fine.,neu
 What flashlight?,neu
 It's not your flashlight.,fru
 It's ours- our flashlight.  It's yours and mine.,xxx
" I mean you keep saying ,my flashlight, as if it's somehow just yours.  How's that suppose to make me feel?",fru
 yes.,neu
 I am cold.,xxx
" It's after eleven, let's go home.",neu
 There is no point in coming out here.,fru
 That's my point.,xxx
 So let's go.,fru
 Not particularly.,neu
 I just don't.,neu
" Pass up what?  Its little fish, one month on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.",fru
" What are you so excited about?  I mean it's not--it's not rocket science we are talking about, its fish.  Its fish nobody even eats.",fru
 I am just not.,neu
 Yes.,neu
" Last year you also remember, our shoes got wet and I got sand in my panties and we got into a big fight.  You had a sore throat and we did not see the grunions.",fru
 We didn't see them the first time either.,fru
 That's the wind.,xxx
" What time is it?  Isn't it supposed to start running around midnight?  This is great, isn't it?  Look at this great night we got here.  Couldn't be better--",exc
 actually I was hoping to go a little bit further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people but I was afraid I will miss it.  How are you doing?,exc
" Is that--no, no no is that foam?  I can't even tell, although if I- if I can't tell, it probably isn't it?  Right It'll probably be unmistakable, but don't you think?  How you doing?",exc
" Oh no, you know what I did.  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I can't believe I forgot my flashlight.",exc
" The flashlight, the silver one, there's only one, isn't there?",fru
 Whose is it?,fru
" Well, Sure.",fru
" No, Of course, you are right.  Our flashlight.  Me flashlight is you flashlight naturally.  How can we not think to bring it?",fru
" Well, I hope the moon stays out.  Well, I wonder do they always wander during a full moon?  I can't remember, wasn't it full last year?  Do you remember?",xxx
" Are you cold?  You want my jacket?  We should have bought a blanket.  Our blanket-.  This is great, isn't it?",exc
" I didn't even think to bring a six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the thing right about now. I can't believe I forgot.  And look at kid, I am surprise I make it out of the house about flies it.",exc
 [LAUGHTER] I wonder if they can hear me talk or if they can feel the vibration in the sand when we are moving around,exc
 you want my jacket?,exc
" Are you kidding?  We'd miss it. We just got here, what's the point of coming out here if we are just going to leave.",xxx
 Right.,exc
 That's my point too.,xxx
" No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is what's the point in coming down here if we are just going to turn around and go home.  Don't you want to see it?",xxx
 Why not?,fru
" Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean,  It happens like once a year.  It's a great opportunity.",exc
" Think about people in Kansas, they have to get a- a plane reservation and a hotel reservation just to see this uh- but we are just forty minutes away.  Too good to pass up.",exc
" Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you- mating or spawning or something like that.",exc
 This is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy. Yeah,exc
 Yeah they do.,xxx
" Okay, but they are fish that do something that no other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the lemmings jumping off a cliff you know like that.",exc
 There's There's mystery here and magic.  A little bit of the unexplainable.  I can't understand how you could not be interested.,exc
 For real?,sur
" I don't get it, the first time we came out here, you said it was the best night of your life and last year I remember distinctly you were so excited that you stuff your toe pushing me out of the door and you didn't notice it until you got into the car.",xxx
 We weren't in a good spot.,fru
 We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  I got a great instinct for these things.,xxx
" Look there, what's that?  Is it?  Is that a--Ah, it's a seaweed isn't it?",exc
" Oh, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world.  I mean think about this. I know you are not interested but think about this for a second.",exc
" Somewhere out there, is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why and we don't know why. They didn't get an invitation.  And it wasn't a vote- it wasn't a decision.  And nobody sent them a map or anything like that.",exc
 It's just some little instinctual time-release firecracker that went off inside them and all this one they turn around and form a line as long as the California coast and just started swimming.,exc
" They are swimming right now as if it's the only thing that matters.  It's- It's single mindedness with no mind, urgency that's pure urge. It's- They don't know what drives them.  They- They don't give any name or ask any question. They just turn as one and started to swim to the very point we are standing right now for a massive celebration of sex and death.  God, it's giving me goose bumps all over my hairs on my arm. popping up.",exc
" Well, So what do you think?",exc
 About what?,xxx
 It's ridiculous.,xxx
" It's PR, somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to occur on the beach.",xxx
" Yeah, they are all told the same thing.  They are all told that you know.  Gets them excited and they can't wait and that if they just get in on the right spot, than you than maybe life will start",xxx
 I am sorry.  It's just fish to me.,fru
" God damn it, Augie.  Why do you always ask things like that?  It's so insulting.",ang
 I just had a different idea of what this evening is going to look like.,fru
" For heaven's sake Augie, grow up we are not going to see the grunions.",fru
 We never do.  Have we ever?  We never have.,fru
" Twice is every time we tried, that's ever.",fru
" No, we won't.  Augie it's like waiting for Santa Claus to come.  I feel like I am going to spend my entire life standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasp expectantly in front of me waiting for the fish to show up and the fish will not show up.",fru
" I did, I do want to see it.  I always want to see it, Augie.",fru
" For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.",fru
" Augie, do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago right after we got married and we thought I was pregnant.",sad
" We had a bottle of champagne but no glasses and you ask me to dance so we took off our shoes and while we were dancing, you said the most intimate things right in my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them.",sad
" And I remember thinking, Finally, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be.",hap
" Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle.",sad
 I rather not remember some things.  I rather not hope for some things.,sad
 No.,sad
 No.,sad
 No.,fru
 No.,xxx
 No.,xxx
 No no.,fru
 I want something to turn out the way it is suppose to turn out.,fru
 This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.,sad
" Sure, this is standing.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.",sad
 But this isn't anything like I thought it would be.,sad
" I mean it is just this , I mean it includes a lot and everything and you know it's the sand and it's the full moon and I just-I am sorry but I couldn't help wishing I was somewhere else.",sad
 I didn't say that.,sad
" For heaven's sake Augie, wherever I am I always wanted to be with you.",sad
" For heaven's sake, don't you know that?",xxx
" Whatever I am doing, I wanted to be with you.  I mean you are probably the one who wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knows how to enjoy herself.",sad
 Good.  So maybe we are on the wrong spot but we are with the right person.,hap
" Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful on the water.  The gold white moon.",hap
" Augie, you bought refreshments.",xxx
 Well than we don't need glasses.,xxx
" No, I am beginning to think that maybe this is the spot after all.",hap
 Or not.,xxx
" Well, so?  What do you think?",exc
 What I was just saying.,fru
 It certainly is not. It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,neu
" I am not the only one, look at all these people.",neu
 Are we talking about the same thing?,xxx
" Carla, can I ask you a question?  Now don't be upset, are you having a period?",neu
 What's bugging you?,fru
" There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunion arrives and they do their little fish thing.  And we say, Oh, wow.  Look at the little fish.  They go home, we go home.",fru
 Why not?,fru
" We miss them twice, it's not ever.",fru
 Well We will see them this year.,neu
 I thought you wanted to see it.,fru
" It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatize over.",fru
" Okay, I been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint a moment when we took a turn for the worst here.",fru
" When you are on the phone with Marge, everything was fine.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem. Let's see, I took a shower and you were watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight and I said, great, let's go I am feeling lucky.",xxx
" Right, so I am putting on my jacket and putting up the animals and pulling the car out of the garage.",xxx
" Wait a minute, I got it.",neu
" It was in the car, right?  When we were passing Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, Let's get some champagne.  And I said time wasting or something like that.  Right? of course.",xxx
" Okay, all right I got it.  You wanted it to be like the other time, okay no problem. Listen, You want to dance?",exc
 You want me to go get some champagne?,exc
 Take off our shoes?,exc
" What, you want me to whisper in your ear?",xxx
 You want to get married again?,fru
 What? What You want a divorce?,fru
" A vacation? A new carpet, a poodle?  A bag of ice cream, a suicide pack, what what Carla?  What the hell do you want?",fru
 What.  Welcome to the human race.,ang
" You think this is what I had in mind?  You think that when I propose I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road, we will end up on a beach arguing over fish. You think that I knew that there would be times when you will look at me like I am used Kleenex?  Or that I will look at you and think, holy hell what's the next flight to Alaska.",xxx
" No, no I was just like you, I thought it will be all peaches and roses and- and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come. And the bills will always magically pay themselves and we will have three fat rosy kids and we will be, HAHA baby the joke is on us.",fru
 Because you know what Carla?  You know what you get?  This.,xxx
 Yes it is.,xxx
 Right.,xxx
" No, I know me either.",sad
 Maybe if you are with somebody else too?,sad
" No, I know, but.  I know I don't make you happy.",sad
 Yeah?,xxx
" Actually, now that you mention it.  No, I don't.",hap
 I don't know.  Seems like a pretty good spot to me I mean look at the view of the moon you got from here.,hap
" Well, look what we have got here.",hap
" Well, it's not champagne.",xxx
 Are you still cold?  You still want to go home?,xxx
" Shh, If we're very quiet, the fish might come.",hap
 Or not.,hap
 You think it's them?,xxx
" Freda is the only one who knows we're up here, and she wouldn't call up.",xxx
 What will be do?,xxx
 Now and always my sweet.,xxx
 It was bound to happen sooner or later.,xxx
" Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.",exc
 Behave exquisitely.,exc
" Yes, I shall probably do a Court Curtsey.",exc
 Um... It's a pity that one can't stay this way forever.,xxx
" Well, it's true.",xxx
 The whole business is really rather ridiculous.,neu
 Meaning exactly that.,neu
 Don't laugh at me; I'm serious.,xxx
 Who's they?,neu
" Well, if I laugh at everything, I must laugh at us, too.",xxx
" Well, what if-what happens when our love-",neu
" How long will it last, this overbearing love of ours?",xxx
" Well, shall we always want to bicker and fight?",xxx
" Oh, dear, shall we like that?",xxx
" Well, what if one of us dies, does the other laugh then?",neu
" Well, that's rather serious, isn't it?",xxx
" My dear, I do believe you're talking nonsense.",xxx
" Elliot, worms don't pop.",xxx
" Oh, thank you dear.  And the same goes for you except that if I so much as see you looking at another woman, I'll kill you.",xxx
 Which particular one?,xxx
 Charles.  That was his name.  He did wriggle so beautifully.,exc
 I know.  You threw him out the window into the canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.,xxx
 It went on intermittently for days.,xxx
" Uh- It burned all the towels in the bathroom, too.",xxx
 That was the first time you ever hit me.,xxx
 And then the manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.,exc
" Oh, ridiculous. utterly ridiculous",hap
 And very much sillier.,xxx
 You knew there was nothing.,neu
 Good God.,exc
 I wonder.,exc
 It must be them then.,xxx
" We're all right, darling, aren't we whatever happens?",xxx
 I don't care then.,xxx
 Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number.,exc
" Oh, what shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?",fea
 With the most perfect poise.,exc
" [LAUGHTER] Oh, the things that ought to matter most dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy, do they?",xxx
" Darling, don't say that.",xxx
" Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?",xxx
" What does it all mean?  That's what I asked myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?",exc
" You mustn't be serious my dear one, that's just what they want.",xxx
" All the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness and light.",exc
 Certainly you must.  We're figures of fun alright [LAUGHTER].,exc
 Who knows?,exc
" No, that fire will fade along with our passion.",exc
 It all depends on how well we played.,exc
" Yes, yes, with all his might.",exc
" No, no it isn't.  Death is very laughable.  Come such a cunning little mystery all done with mirrors.",exc
" no, So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and --",exc
 enjoy the party as long as we can like very little quite idiotic schoolchildren. [garbage] Let's savor the delight of the moment.,exc
" Darling, come here and kiss me before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.",exc
" I don't mind what you do, see, you could paint your body green all over and dance naked through the Place Vendome and run off with every man in the world.  And I shan't say a word as long as I know that you love me best.",xxx
 Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,exc
 The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed.,exc
" Horrible thing, I hate it.",exc
 How long did that row last?,exc
 The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.,exc
" Oh, that was quite a rouser, wasn't it?",exc
" Oh, I didn't hit you very hard.",neu
 [LAUGHTER] I shall never forget his face.,exc
" Oh, we were very much younger then.",exc
" Oh, As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",exc
 You knew there was nothing in that.,neu
 Only a trivial little broach.,neu
" No, not at all.  I-I still have it.  I wear it quite often.",xxx
 You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.,neu
" maybe just a little, but--",neu
 And what of it?,neu
" Well, I- he got a lot of pleasure out of it and it didn't hurt me.",neu
" Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious, you never would have heard about it.",xxx
 I'm growing quite tired and bored of this conversation.,fru
 No.,xxx
 I don't see why you want any.  You've already had three glasses.,neu
" Well, it seems silly to go on and on in such a thing.",neu
 It's becoming a habit with you.,neu
 Don't be so stupid.,xxx
 Just making myself fascinating for you.,neu
 It's the woman's job to allure the man.  Why don't you watch me for a moment?,xxx
" No, it's not.",xxx
" Oh, Do shut up.",xxx
" Um, It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.",ang
" adder don't snap, they sting.",ang
 They sting.,ang
" I don't care if they bark and roll around like hoops, okay.",ang
" Yes, I did quite a bit.",neu
 Mind your own business.,ang
" Oh dear, you really are becoming quite insufferable.  I would imagine it's because you're drunk.",ang
" Oh no, on the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass.",xxx
" Oh, You are so insufferable.  Do you stop.",fru
" Not very funny, dear, you better have some more brandy.",ang
 Ugh.,fru
 Why?,ang
 There aren't any people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.,ang
 They're away in Tunis.,ang
 Turn it on again.,ang
" Fine, if you insist on being completely insolent.",ang
" Well, do try to control yourself darling.",ang
 You really do need to develop uh a clearer head.,ang
 I- I hate you.,ang
 I hate you.,ang
" No, no.  I'm tired of listening to you.  You're boorish and idiotic and completely overbearing.",ang
" Yeah, very amusing.  Let me go.  I'm getting out of here.  I can't believe I intended to marry you.",ang
" Oh, marry you again?  I must have been insane.  What was I thinking?  I mean, you're completely outrageous.",ang
 Beast; brute; cad; whore,ang
" As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",xxx
 I knew nothing of the sort.  You accepted presents from him.,xxx
" I remember it well, covered in diamonds in the worst possible taste.",xxx
 You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,xxx
" You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?",ang
 You let him kiss you.  You said you did.,ang
 What of it?,fru
 What about me?,xxx
" Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.",ang
" So am I, bored stiff.  Would you like some brandy?",neu
 I'll have a little I think.,neu
" No particular reason, besides, they were very small ones.",xxx
 You can hardly call three liqueur glasses of brandy in a whole evening going on and on.,xxx
 You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want any at the moment.,ang
" Really, Amanda.",ang
" Going out somewhere, dear?",xxx
" Oh, that reply has broken my heart.",ang
" As a matter of fact, that is perfectly true.",xxx
" Oh, yes it is.",fru
 It's a pity you didn't take a little more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.,ang
" Well, snap, snap, snap like a little adder.",xxx
" Nonsense, they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.",xxx
 They snap.,ang
 [BREATHING],fru
 Did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?,ang
 I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then.,ang
" You must have a riotous time, no restraint at all, very enjoyable.  I mean, you never had much anyway.",ang
 I'm not the least bit drunk.,xxx
 I think I mentioned once before that I had only three-minute liqueur glasses of brandy the entire evening long.  A child of two could not be drunk on that.,xxx
" Oh, very interesting.  How about a child of three or a child of six?  How about a child of nine?",xxx
" Oh, This is very interesting.  We- we might get a splendid debate going about this intemperate tots.",fru
" Oh, very good idea.  I will.",xxx
 You better turn that off I think.,fru
 It's very late and it will disturb the people upstairs.,xxx
" Well, there are people downstairs I suppose.",xxx
 It is not time of year for Tunis.,xxx
 I'll do no such thing.,xxx
 Turn it off.  It is driving me mad.,ang
 Turn it off.,ang
 Turn it off.,ang
 Amanda-- Listen- Listen-,ang
 Very music- amusing indeed.,ang
" You are a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast, and I never want to set eyes on you again.",ang
" Shut up, shut up.  I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee. You're a mean, evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never set eyes on you again.",ang
 Can I help you?,neu
" Oh, this- this form that you have is the wrong form.  You need to go over to the other line on the other side of the D.M.V..",neu
" Right, but this is the wrong form.  Somebody gave you the wrong form.",neu
" Yeah.  So, I can't -- I can't do anything-",neu
" No, but this is for um- replacements and you need a new -- whole new license as a California --",neu
" Sir, don't get an attitude with me.",fru
" No, I understand and there are a lot of people here.  But what I'm telling you is that it's different for different states and since your getting a new license in the state of California -- You have to fill out a different form than you did.",neu
 I don't know.  I don't know who told you.  It wasn't me.,fru
" You- You can ask her if you want, but she's busy and she probably won't answer you.",fru
 I know.,neu
" Sir, you- I mean",fru
 You can waist as much as you want,fru
 Yeah.  I know it's gonna take a minute.  But you-- so you might as well get started now.,neu
" I can't take this one, sir. this is the wrong form.",fru
" Sir, please don't waste my time.",fru
 There is nothing I can do about it.  You need to take this other form and fill it out and go stand in the other line.,fru
" They're different forms, we process them all different-",fru
 I -- there's no way I'd make an exception.,fru
" Sir, don't patronize me.  I can't make an exception.  I don't- I don't have the power to do that.  It's a different form.",fru
 They're processed differently.,fru
" Sir, you're gonna have to go stand in the other line.",fru
 I'm gonna- I'm gonna bring security over and have them escort you out.,ang
 But you filled out the wrong form and you're in the wrong line and you're wasting both of our times.,fru
" Well, that's unfortunate, sir.  You're gonna have to go stand in the other line now.",ang
" Yes, I'm um- just getting my I.D.  I need a new I.D.",xxx
 What do you mean?  I filled out my forms and I rushed to get my I.D.,xxx
 The wrong form?,xxx
 What's wrong about this form?  It says new I.D. on it.,xxx
 What's the difference?  What's the difference between that form and this form?,fru
" I'm not getting a -- well, you wait in this line and not get an attitude.",ang
 yeah.,xxx

" I don't- you know ,I feel the same way, you know what I mean.  And everybody says a lot of other crap you know, they don't know what they are talking about anyway.",exc

 Exactly.  You make it what you make it. You know? Right? And I'm gonna make it so freaking awesome.,exc
 yeah.,exc

" Yeah, yeah.  I- I don't- I don't know.  Do you have any suggestions?",exc
 You know the area better than I do.,exc

 It's just you know a dream come true.  How could you not be excited about a dream come true?,exc
" Oh I know, I know.",exc
" But I'm so looking forward to being so busy. You know what I mean?  It's the kind of busy you've got to love, right?",exc
 Because you're doing something you love.  That's the kind of busy you want.  I want to be able to do that for the rest of my life.  Be that kind of busy.,exc
 I had to tell you right away.  I knew you'd be excited.,exc
 We'll have fun.,hap
 Great.  Okay.,exc
" Hi, I need- I need some help.  I've been transferred to, like, eight different departments and I've told my problem to every single department, and then they just send me to another one and say they are going to send all my information so I won't have to repeat it, and then that person doesn't know what's going on.  And I've restated my story about eight different times and I just want somebody to help me get my connection back, because this happens every two weeks.  And I want to know what to do to stop it from happening again.",fru
 Yeah.  That my service just goes out.,fru
 yeah.,fru
" And I'll reset the IP address.  I will do like, you know, direct connect the modem to my computer, and then reset everything, and then put the router back in. And-",fru
" Is not, It it It will work again for like a week and then it goes out again.",fru
" Uh, yeah.  We've pinned it a couple of times.",neu
" Pretty much, yeah - I don't know if it's, like, bad phone lines or something.",neu
 Hmm. Mmm.,neu
 yeah.,neu
" It goes- It goes, like, through doorways.  But it goes a long distance.",neu
 Oh really?,xxx
" Well, I- I can check that.  Is there anything else we can do, too?  Like, I'll go through and check the line throughout the house, but --",neu
 Uh huh.,neu
 All right.,neu
" Yeah, I see that.",neu
 Okay.,neu
 Okay.,neu
" Uh, it it's like a bunch of different letter and numbers and stuff.",neu
" Uh huh, Okay.",neu
" Uh, yeah looks -- no, no.  It's set to zeros.",neu
" what happening - So if we reset this, how will I know it's not going to happen again every other week?",xxx
 Wow.  That would be amazing.  Really?,sur
" Oh, my God.  I can't even tell you how much of a relief that is.  I literally call and talk to five different people.  Like last week it went off and I spent an hour and a half on the phone with different people.  And I've been doing that like every, every other week for months now.",hap
 It's so frustrating.,fru
 Thank you so much.,xxx
" Yeah, accountability.  It's awesome.",hap
" Wow.  You know I was thinking about changing internet providers, but but that- that really is enough to change my mind.",hap
 No.  I'm just gonna go have a fantastic day now.,hap
 Okay.  Thanks.,hap
" D.S.L. Extreme, can I help you?",neu
 This happens every two weeks?,neu
 You've lost your connection.,neu
 okay.,neu
 Hmm.  Mmm.,neu
 Has somebody tried to pin your site?,neu
" Okay. Um-  Well, I don't know.  And it consistently happens every two weeks?",neu
" Well, you know what, does your D.S.L. cable -- you have D.S.L., right?",neu
" Okay.  Does your D.S.L. cable, you know, travel a long distance by any chance? - Does it go through any windows?  I mean, is it --",neu
" Okay.  Is it being- Is it being compressed between anything by any chance?  Because sometimes your connection can be you know, disrupted by, you know, the cable being squished.",neu
" Yeah. That can be- That can create a bad connection.  And it won't always be a bad connection, but it will be bad off and on.",neu
" Yeah, well, absolutely.  What we can -- let's just go ahead and just do a basic diagnostic of your system first off, okay.  Can you go down to your start button?",neu
" Okay, And uh- go ahead and click on run.",neu
 Okay.  We're gonna get your -- a little black box is going to come up.  Do you see that?,neu
" Okay Uh- You've got your C calling, go ahead and type in directory list.",neu
 And hit enter.,neu
 Okay?  Can you tell me what that says?,neu
" Okay Okay, And Um- letters and numbers and stuff.  Uh- Can you - Can you just type in IP address search? And hit enter.",neu
 Okay?  Does it list your IP address there?,neu
" It's set to zeros.  Okay, maybe that's our problem.  That could very well be our problem there.  Somehow you've lost your IP address.  I'm not sure why that would happen every week.  It could be a cycling issue, something like that.  But let's go ahead and type your IP address in again.",neu
" Well, if it does happen again, let me give you my direct number and you can call me.  Actually, I'll give you my cell number. Um- It's --",neu
" Of course.  we seriously- Yeah, I mean, obviously you've worked- you know -- I don't want to hassle you anymore.",neu

 All right.  You have a wonderful day.  Call us anytime.,neu
" All right.  Bye, bye.",hap
 What's he going to say?  Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.,sad
 When?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed.  How could he have seen it?,sad
 When?,xxx
 What was he doing out here at four in the morning?,xxx
 Did you talk to him?,sad
 He cried hard?,sad
" What was he doing out there at that hour?  He's getting just like after Larry died, walking around at night.  He dreams.",xxx
 What's the meaning of that?,xxx
 What?,xxx
 What do you mean dishonest?,xxx
" What do you want to do, argue with him?",fru
 You can't say that to him.,xxx
 how are you gonna prove it?  Can you prove it?,fru
" To you it is and to me, but not to him.  Now you can talk yourself until you're blue in the face, Chris, but there's no body and there's no grave.  So where are you?",fru
" The trouble is the God damn newspapers.  I mean every every week a kid turns up, missing like longer than Larry.",ang
 Why?,xxx
" Well, I have an idea.  But what's the story?",xxx
" Well, that's your business, Chris.",xxx
" Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough to make- to know your own mind.",ang
" Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't --",xxx
 I'm just saying.,fru
" I ignore what I got to ignore.  I mean, the girl is Larry's girl.",ang
" From your father's point of view he's not dead and she's still his girl.  Now, you can go on from there if you know where to go, Chris, but I don't know.  So what can I do for you?",ang
" Well, you're a considerate fella, there's nothing wrong in that",neu
 Have you asked Annie yet?,neu
" Well, what if she feels like your father?  And how do you know she will marry you?",neu
" Well, the trouble is you never saw enough women.",neu
" Well, I just don't see why it has to be Annie.",fru
" Well, that's a good reason.  But that doesn't mean anything at all.  I mean, you haven't seen her in five years.",fru
" No.  I don't want a -- look, your father thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now, what's going to happen to your father; do you know?  Because, I don't.",fru
 Just give it some more thought.,xxx
 What the hell is this?,sur
 Are you crazy?,ang
" What?  You mean?  Tell me something, you mean that you would leave the business?",xxx
 You can't think like that.,xxx
" All right.  But don't think like that.  Because what the hell did we work for, Chris?  I mean, this whole thing, it's all for you.",ang
 Just don't think that way.  Do you hear me?,ang
" I don't understand you, do I?",fru
" Yeah, I can see that.",fru
 He saw it.,xxx
 He was out here when it broke.,xxx
" I don't know, like, four o'clock this morning.  I heard a crack, and I woke up, and I looked out the window and he was standing right there when it broke.",xxx
" I don't know, but after it broke he ran back inside and started crying in the kitchen.",xxx
 No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.,sad
 I could hear him right through the floor in my room.,xxx
 I guess he is.,xxx
" I don't know the meaning of it, but you know one thing Mom, we made a terrible mistake with dad.",xxx
 Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.,xxx
 You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?,fru
 I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time he knows that nobody else thinks that Larry's alive anymore.,fru
" Why should he dream about him, walking around looking for him at night?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now?",ang
 We have to say it to him.,fru
 For Gods sake!  Three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  That's insane!,ang
" Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.",xxx
" All right.  All right, mom.  Just listen.  You know why I invited Annie her, don't you?",fru
 You know.,neu
 I'm going to ask her to marry me.,neu
 It's not just my business.,fru
 So it's okay then?  I should just go ahead and do it?,fru
" Oh, so it isn't just my business?",ang
 You infuriate me sometimes.  Do you know that?  God.,ang
" Isn't it your business, too, if dad -- if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  I mean, you have such a talent for ignoring things.",ang
 She is not Larry's girl!,ang
" I don't know why it is but everytime I reach out for something I- that I want, I have to pull back because I might hurt somebody else.  My whole bloody life; time after time after time.",fru
 To hell with that!,ang
 I wanted to get this taken care of first.,xxx
" Well, if that's the case, then that's the end of it.  But from her letters it sounds like she has forgotten him.  I'll find out.  And then we'll thrash it out with dad, all right?  Mom, don't avoid me.",xxx
 So what?  I'm not fast with women.,ang
 Because it is.,fru
" I know her best, all right?  I don't know.  I grew up next to her.  When I think of somebody for my wife these days, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?",fru
" All right then, mom.",xxx
" I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I'd waited, dad would have forgotten about it by now.  And we could have like a normal wedding and everybody happy.",ang
" But if that can't happen, I'll just have to get out.",ang
" I'll get out.  I'll go get married and live someplace else.  I don't know, maybe New York.",ang
 I have been a good son for too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.,ang
" Yes.  On this, I would.",ang
" Well, you help me stay here.",ang
" I know that, mom.  Just, you help me stay here.",fru
 I am thinking that way.,xxx
" No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.",fru
 What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.,sad
" What do you mean?  I was the first one up, he was still in bed.",sur
 When?,xxx
 What was he doing out here four in the morning?,xxx
 Did you talk to him?,xxx
 He's dreaming about him again.  He's getting just like after Larry died. What's the meaning of that?,xxx
 What?,xxx
 What do you mean dishonest?,xxx
" What are you gonna do, argue with him?",xxx
" Well, how are you gonna prove it?  Can you prove it?",xxx
" To you it is and to me, but not to him.",xxx
 You can talk yourself blue in the face but there's no body and there's no grave.  So where are you?,xxx
" The trouble is the God damn newspapers, I mean, ea- each week a new boy turns up out of nowhere.  So the next one is gonna be Larry.  So you--",fru
 Why?,xxx
" Well, I've got an idea but what's the story?",xxx
" Well, that's your business, Chris.",xxx
" What do you want me to do?  I mean, You're old enough to know your own mind.",fru
" Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't gonna --",xxx
" I ignore what I got to ignore.  I mean, the girl is Larry's girl.",fru
" As far as your father is concerned, he's not dead.  And she's still his girl.",xxx
" Now, you can go on with this if you know where to go, but I don't know where to go.",xxx
" Well, you're a considerate fella.  There's nothing wrong with that.",xxx
 Have you asked Annie yet?,neu
" Well, how do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels like your father does.",neu
 The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.,neu
 I just don't see why it has to be Annie.,xxx
" Well, that's a good reason.  But it don't mean a thing. I mean, You haven't seen her since you went to war.  It's been five years.",neu
" No I don't want a-  Your father thinks he's coming back, Chris.  If you marry that girl, you're pronouncing him dead.",fru
" Now, what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't.",sad
 Just give it some more thought.,xxx
 What the hell is this?,sur
 Are you crazy?,ang
 But you have a business here.  What the hell is this?,xxx
 Must you be inspired?,ang
 You don't want to think like that.,ang
" All right.  But don't think like that because what the hell did we work for, Chris?  All of this, all of it, it's all just for you.",fru
" Don't think like that, do you hear me?",xxx
" I don't understand you, do I?",fru
" Yeah, I can see that.",xxx
 He saw it.,xxx
 He was out here when it broke.,sad
 About four this morning.  I heard it crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right there when it cracked.,sad
" I don't know.  But after he saw it, he ran back into the house and started crying in the kitchen.",sad
 No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.,sad

 You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?,xxx
 I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time that he knows that nobody else believes that Larry's alive. I mean,fru
" Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for a long time?",fru
" For Gods sake, three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane!",fru
" Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.",xxx
" All right.  All right, just listen.",fru
" You know why I invited Annie, right?",xxx
 You know.,xxx
 I'm gonna ask her to marry me.,xxx
 You know it's not just my business.,fru
 So it's all right then?  I should just go ahead with it?,fru
" So it isn't just my business?  You infuriate me sometime, you know that.",xxx
" Isn't it your business, too, if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things.",ang
 She's not Larry's girl.,ang

 what to hell with that!,ang
 I wanted to get this settled first.,xxx
" Well, if she does then that's the end of it.  But from her letters it seems like she's forgotten him.",xxx
" I'll find out and then we'll thrash it out with dad, all right?  Mom, don't avoid me.",fru
" So what, I'm not fast with women?",fru
 Because it is.,fru
" [garbage] I don't know.  It's just,",fru
" she's who I know best. I know her since I- I was a kid I grew up with her.  When I think of somebody for my wife these days, I I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?",fru

" I've been a good son for too long, a good sucker.  I'm through with it.",xxx
 The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,ang
" Yeah, I'd like one hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, I'd like to go home to something beautiful.  I'd like a family.  I'd like some kids.",ang
" I'd like to build something that's my own.  And Annie is in the center of that.  Now, where do I find it?",xxx
" Well, you help me stay here.",xxx
" I know that, mom.  Just you help me stay here.",fru
" Well, I am thinking like that.",ang
" No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.",ang
 Why did you invite her here?,xxx
" She's been in New York three and a half years, why all of a sudden?",xxx
 Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,neu
 He's not going to marry her.,xxx
 He's got that about it.,neu
" What's going on here, Joe?",ang
" No.  She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.",xxx
" Then why is she still single? I mean, New York is full of men.  Why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish but she's waited.",xxx
" Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.",xxx
" Nobody in this house dares takes her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",xxx
" I want you to pretend like he's coming back.  Both of you, don't think I haven't noticed you and Chris since she's gotten here.  I don't want any nonsense.",fru
" No, because if she- he's not coming back then I'll kill myself. Laugh!  Laugh at me!",fru
 But why did that happen the very night she came back?  She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it.,xxx
" Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand alone.",xxx
 Only last week a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  You read it yourself.,fru
 You above all have got to believe.,ang
 Just don't stop believing.,xxx
 I can't help it.,ang
 Why does that bother you?,neu
" Well, maybe maybe he just wanted to see her again.",neu
" What are you talking about?  He grew up next to the girl his whole life, why wouldn't he want to see her again?  Don't look at me like that.  He hasn't told me anything he didn't told you.",fru
 Why do you think he's even thinking that?,neu
" Well, so what?",fru
 Now listen.,fru
 You don't know.  You can't read her mind.,xxx
 How do you know why she's waited?,fru
" Look, it's a beautiful day outside, why are we arguing?",fru
" Well, what do you want me to do about it?  What do you want?",fru
 But Kate?,fru
 Calm yourself.,fru
 Calm yourself.,fru
 All right.  All right.,fru
" What do you mean, me above all?",xxx
" What's that suppose to mean, me above all?  Look at you, you're shaking.",ang
" What have I got to hide, Kate?  What the hell is the matter with you?",ang
 You're the only one I know who loves his parents.,neu
 It's all right.  It's a good thing.  It's lovely here.  The air is sweet.,hap
 No.  But I'm not going to stay.,xxx
" Well, your mother, first of all, pretty much told me to leave.",neu
 You saw that.  And well you've been --,xxx
 You've been sort of embarrassed since I got here.,xxx
" I figured they would, your mother at least.",neu
" Well, from her perspective, I mean, why else would I come here?",neu
" Yes, that's why I came.",xxx
" Oh, Chris I've been ready for a long time.",hap
 I almost got married two years ago.,sad
 You started to write me.,xxx
 Everyday since.,hap
" Well, I mean, until then you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  I mean, you sure can be ambiguous.",exc
 I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait so long?  All this time I've sat around wondering if I was crazy for thinking of you.,xxx
 Not like that you're not.,exc
" Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What's the matter?",sad
" No.  Chris, what is it?  Is it your mother?",xxx
 You have to tell me.,xxx
 Even in your letters there was something ashamed.,sad
 You have to tell me.,sad
 It wouldn't work like this.,sad
" Yeah, sure.",neu
 How many?,sad
 Do you still feel like that?,sad
" Because you can't feel like that anymore, Chris.  Because everything you have, you have a right to, me included.",sad
" And you father, he put hundreds of planes in the air and you should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.",xxx
 [LAUGHTER] What will I do with a fortune?,hap
" I know.  It's going out of style, isn't it?",xxx
" So, you're not sorry I came?",exc
 Why?,sur
 Well-,neu
 What?,xxx
" Well, I planned on kind of sneaking up on you in a period of a week or so, but they all take it for granted that we're set.",xxx
 How did you know?,xxx
" Well, so would you want to?  I mean, I guess you know that's why I asked you to come.",xxx
" Annie, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you. -I",xxx
" I don't know what to say.  I have no imagination.  That's all I have to say to you.  God, I'm embarrassing you. I-I didn't want to do this here. I- I wanted to do it someplace different, someplace where we could be new to each other.",xxx
" You feel it's wrong here, don't you; this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me, Annie. I- I don't want to win you away from anything.",exc
 So he's gone forever then?  You sure?,xxx
 Why didn't you?,sur
 You felt something that far back?,hap
" Annie, why didn't you call me or tell me?",xxx
" Give me a kiss, Annie.  Give me a --",xxx
" oh, God I kissed Annie.  I kissed Annie. I can't How long have I waited to do that?",exc
" Oh, Annie, we're gonna live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.",exc
 I kissed you.,sur
 Lets go for a ride.  I I- I want to be alone with you.,sad
" No, nothing like that.",sad
" Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going for me.",sad
 I don't I don't know where to start.,neu
 It's so mixed up with so many other things.,sad
" You remember when I was overseas, I was in command of a company?",xxx
 I lost them.,sad
 Just about all.,sad
" It- It takes time to toss something like that off,I mean, because they weren't just men.",sad
" For instance, there was this time, and it had been raining for several days, and this kid came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks, just put them in my pocket.",xxx
 I know it's it's just a little thing but that's just the kind of guys I had.  They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.,sad
" I mean that exactly, anymore selfish -- just a little bit more selfish and they would have been here today. And it gave me an idea as I was watching them all go down.",sad
" Everything was being destroyed see, but I felt like something new was being created at the same time.  Like it kind of -- responsibility.  You know, man to man.  Do you understand what I'm saying?",xxx
" And and to see that again, to to bring that back on the earth again, like- like a monument that that would stand behind these men and and and it would make a difference to them.",xxx
 It was and then I went home.  And it was incredible.  It didn't have any meaning there.,sad
" I mean, the whole thing was like some kind of bus accident to them.",xxx
 So I went back to work for my dad and that whole rat race again.,xxx
" I felt what you said, ashamed somehow because nobody had changed at all.",sad
" It seemed to make suckers out of so many guys.  And I-I felt wrong to be alive; to to open that bank book, to to drive that car, the new car, and look at that new refrigerator. I mean,",fru
" you can take those things out of the war, but if you're gonna drive that car you've got to know that that came from the love a man can have from a man. And you've got to be a little bit better because of that.  Because if you're not, then it's all just loot and there's blood on it and I didn't want any of it.",fru
 And I guess that included you.,sad
" I want you now, Annie.",sad
" Oh, Annie,",exc
 Annie I am going to make you a fortune.,hap
 Fine.,sad
 What flashlight?,neu
 You mean our flashlight?,xxx
" I mean, you kept saying my flashlight, the flashlight like it was only somehow yours.  How is that supposed to make me feel?",xxx
 Yes.,xxx
 I'm cold.,xxx
 It's after eleven.  Let's just go home.,xxx
 There is no point in coming out here.,xxx
 That's my point.,xxx
 So let's go.,xxx
 Not particularly.,xxx
 I just don't.,xxx
 it's stupid.,xxx
 Pass what up?  It's It's just little fish and they swim up on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.,fru
" What are you so excited about.  This isn't rocket science, this is just fish.  Fish nobody even eats.",fru
 Augie.,fru
 I'm just not.,sad
 Yes.,xxx
" Well, if you also remember last year we- our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, we had a big argument, you had a sore throat, and we didn't see the grunion.",fru
 We didn't see them the first time either.,fru
 That's the wind.,xxx
" What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  Oh, this is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here.  It couldn't be better.  Actually, I wanted to go a little further up the coast you know to get away from all the lights and the people.  I was afraid we might miss it though, so how are you doing?",exc
" What's that? Is that- Wait, is that foam?  I can't even tell.  Oh Actually, I guess if I can't tell then it probably isn't it, is it?  It will probably be unmistakable, don't you think?",exc
" This is great.  How are you doing?  Oh, no.  Oh, do you know what I did?  I forgot the flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I forgot the flashlight.",exc
" The flashlight.  The silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?  Stupid.",exc
 Well-,xxx
" Oh, no, of course, our flashlight.  Me flashlight is to you flashlight, naturally.",exc
" How could we have forgotten it? Well, I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember, was the moon full last year, do you remember?",exc
" Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.  Oh, this is great.  I didn't even think to bring a six pack.  Oh, a six pack would be just the ticket right about now.",exc
" I can't believe I forgot.I'm like a little kid.  I'm surprised I made it out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh, [LAUGHTER]",exc
" Oh, I wonder if they can hear me or if they can feel the vibrations when we move around in the sand. or something",exc
 Do you want my jacket?,exc
" Are you kidding?  We just got here, we'd miss it.  What's the point of coming all the way out here if we're just going to turn around and go home?",xxx
 Right.,xxx
" That's my point, too.",xxx
" Oh, no, no, no.  no That's not my point.  My point is what's the point coming out here if we're just going to leave?  Don't you want to see it?",xxx
 Why not?,xxx
 Oh,fru
" Honey, it's a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this kind of thing only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.",exc
" I mean, Think about people in Kansas, they've got to get like you know plane tickets and hotel reservations just to see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's just too good of an opportunity to pass up.",exc
" Yeah, but all that time on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  You know,",exc
" and all that about flopping around, it's like laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating or something like that.",exc
" I mean, this is a big night for these guys.  You know, life's last orgy.",exc
" Yeah, they do.",fru
" All right.  But they are fish that do something no other fish do.  Like the swallows were turning into Capistrano or Lemmings jumping off the cliffs, you know like that. There's- There's magic here and mystery.  And a little bit of the unexplainable.  You know, I can't see how you could not be interested.",exc
 For real?,fru
" I don't get it.  I mean, the first time we came you said it was the best night of your life. And last year I remember distinctly you were so excited about coming that you stubbed your toe toe pushing me out the door and you didn't even notice until you got in the car.",fru
 We weren't in a good spot.,xxx
 We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  I've got a great sense for these things.,xxx
" Look there.  What is that?  Is that -- Oh No, that's seaweed.",exc
" Oh, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world. I mean, think about this, I know you're not interested but just think about this for a second;",exc
 somewhere out there is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why they're doing it.  We don't know why they're doing it.  They didn't- It wasn't a decision.  No one took a vote.  Nobody sent them an invitation or a map or anything like that.  It was just some internal time release fire cracker that went off. And all as one they turned around and formed this giant line as long as the California coastline and they just started swimming.  They are swimming right now at this very moment.   And And-,exc
" And it's single mindedness with no mind. It- It's urgency, it's pure urge.  I mean, they didn't make any decisions.  They don't ask any questions.  They don't give it a name,",exc
" they just all as one turn around and start swimming to this very point where we are standing now for one last celebration of sex and death. God, it's giving me Goosebumps.  Look at all the hairs that are standing up.",exc
" Well, so what do you think?",exc
 About what?,neu
 It's ridiculous.,neu
 It's P.R. somebody sold you a bill of goods that this magical thing would be happening on the beach.,xxx
" Sure.  Everybody is told the same thing, it keeps us all excited.  It keeps us all coming back for more.  It keeps us thinking that life is gonna start now any minute if we can just find the right spot and get in on the action.",xxx
" I'm sorry.  It's just, it's it's just fish to me.",fru
" God damn it, Augie.  Seriously, you always ask me that.  Why do you ask me that?  I hate it.  It's so insulting.",ang
 I just - We just have different ideas of what this night is suppose to look like.,fru
" For God's sake, Augie.  It's- Grow up, we're not going to see the grunion.",xxx
 We We don't ever.  Have we ever?,fru
" Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever",ang
" No, we won't.  It's like waiting up for Santa Clause or something.  I feel like as though my whole life is going to be standing on the beach waiting with my eyes opened expectantly, my hands clasped neatly in front of me, waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish will not show up.",ang
 You don't understand anything I am saying.,fru
 I did want to see it.  I always want to see it.  I just- I keep thinking this will be the time and it never is.,sad
 Do you remember the first time that we came to see the grunion?  It was about four years ago right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant.  We had a bottle of champagne and no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  We took off our shoes.  And while we were dancing you said the most intimate things to me right in my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.,sad
" And I remember thinking to myself, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be.",sad
" Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.",sad
 I would rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for something.,sad
 No.,sad
 No.,sad
 No.,sad
 [LAUGHTER] No.,xxx
 No.,xxx
 No.,sad
 I just want- I just want things to turn out the way they are supposed to.,sad
 This?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.,xxx
" Sure, this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.",xxx
 But this isn't at all what I wanted it to be.,sad
" This is just this.  I mean, it's a lot and everything.  But it's not, you know, something else.  Am I making any sense?",sad
" I know that, Augie.  I do.  I know that. And and I know that this meant a lot to you and and it's special, you know, with the sand and the moon but.",sad
 But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.,sad
 I didn't say that.,sad
" For heavens sake, Augie, whatever I am doing, I'd rather it be with you.",sad
" Yes.  Don't you know that? I mean, You're probably the one you wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knew how to enjoy herself.",sad
" Okay.  Well, we're in the wrong spot but we're with the right person.",xxx
" Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful over the water.  Big old white moon.",hap
" Augie, you brought refreshments.",xxx
" Well, then we don't need glasses.",xxx
" No.  I'm beginning to think you might be right. I think  this might be the spot after all.  Augie, I'm sorry.",hap
 Or not.,hap
" Well, so, what do you think?",exc
 What I was just saying.,exc
 It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,fru
" I'm not the only one, look at all these people.",xxx
 Are we talking about the same thing?,xxx
" uh, Carla Can I ask you a question?  no, don't get upset, but are you having your period?",neu
 What's bugging you then?,fru
" It's not that complicated.  We come down here, the grunions arrive, they do their little fish thing.  We say ooh, awe, look at the little fish.  And then they go home and we go home.",fru
 Why not?,xxx
 We've missed them twice.  That's hardly ever.,fru
" Well, we'll see them this year.",xxx
" Okey, They're just fish.  It's nothing to get traumatized over.",fru
" No, of course not.",fru
" I'm trying to work this backwards.  But I can't seem to pinpoint the time where everything went wrong here.  Okay, so --",fru
" you were fine on the phone call with Marge, eating dinner was fine,talking- uh washing the dishes, no problem.  All right.  So, I'm taking a shower, you're watching TV, the news and you say the grunions are running tonight and I say, Great, let's go.  I'm feeling lucky.  And so, all right, and I'm putting on my coat, I'm putting out the animals, I'm pulling the car out of the garage.",fru
 Wait a minute.  I've got it.,xxx
" It was in the car, right?  When we were passing Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, Let's stop and get champagne. and I said that times a wasting or something like that, right?  You wanted it to be like it was before, right?",neu
" Okay.  All right No problem.  I totally understand. okey  um, listen.  Do you want to dance?",xxx
 Do you want me to go get some champagne?,xxx
 Take off our shoes?,xxx
" What, you want me to blow in your ear?",fru
" Do you want to get married again?- What?  What, do you want a divorce?",fru
 A vacation?,fru
" A poodle, a backrub, a spa, a suicide pack?  What, Carla, what the hell do you want?",fru
" Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had planned?  Do you think that when I proposed that I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we would end up arguing on the beach over some fish?",ang
" Do you think that I thought there would be times when you would look at me like I was used Kleenex or I would look at you and think, good God, when's the next flight to Alaska?  No.  No, I'm just like you. I thought it would all be like peaches and roses, and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish would always come.  And the bills would magically pay themselves.  And we'd have three fat rosy kids.  But, ha ha, baby, the jokes on us!",ang
" Because you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.",ang
" Yes, it is.",xxx
 Right.,fru
" Now, I know.  Me either",sad
 I'm trying the best I can.,sad
" Maybe if you're with somebody else, too?",sad
" No, I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.",sad
 Really?,sur
" Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.",hap
" I don't know.  I think this is a pretty good spot.  I mean, look at the view of the moon from here.",hap
" Oh, well look what we've got here.",hap
" Well, it isn't champagne.",hap
 Are you still cold?  Still want to go home?,xxx
" Shh.  If we're really quiet, the fish might come.",xxx
 Or not.,hap
 Do you think it's them?,fea
" what, Nobody knows we are here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.",exc
 What do we do?,exc
" Now and always, my sweet.",exc
 It was bound to happen sooner or later.,exc
" Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.",exc
 Behave exquisitely.,xxx
 I shall probably do a Court Curtsey.,xxx
 What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.,xxx
" Well, it's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.",xxx
 Meaning just that.,xxx
 Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.,neu
 Who's they?,neu
" If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too.",neu
" Oh, how long will it last, this ludicrous, overbearing love of ours?",xxx
" Well, will we always bicker and fight?",neu
" Oh, dear.  Shall we like that?",xxx
" What if one of us dies, does the other one laugh then?",neu
" That's rather serious, isn't it?",xxx
" Darling, I do believe you're talking nonsense.",xxx
" Elliott, worms don't pop.",neu
" Uhh, Thank you, darling.  And the same goes for you, except that if I ever see you so much as look at another woman, I'll kill you.",xxx
 Which particular one?,xxx
" Awe, Charles.  That was his name.  He did wriggle so beautifully.",xxx
 I know you did.  You threw it out the window into the Canal below.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.,exc
 It went on intermittently for days.,xxx
" Oh, It burnt my comb and all the towels in the bathroom.",exc
 That was the first time you hit me.,xxx
" And then the manager came in and saw us all rolling all over the floor, biting and scratching one another. [LAUGHTER]",xxx
" How ridiculous, utterly ridiculous",xxx
 Very much sillier.,xxx
 You knew there was nothing in that.,neu
 Oh Good God.,xxx
 I wonder.,exc
 Must be them then?,fea
" We're all right, aren't we, darling, whatever happens?",neu
 I don't care then.,exc
 Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number.,xxx
" Oh, what shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us.",exc
 With the worst- with the most perfect poise?,exc
" Uhh, It's amazing how once you feel--",exc
" things that ought to matter most dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they?",exc
" Uhh, You mustn't say that, my darling.",exc
" Being that sacred and wonderful thing, love.",exc
" Um What does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my endless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?",exc
" You mustn't be serious, darling.  That's just what they want.",exc
" All the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them, Be flippant.  Laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths.",exc
 uh- the- Being flippant brings out the acid in their damned beauty and light.,exc
 Certainly you must.  We are figures of fun all right.,exc
 [garbage] who knows?,xxx
 No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.,exc
" Well, it depends on how well we played.",xxx
" Yes, yes, with all his might.",exc
" No, no that is quit laughable.  The cutting little mystery all done with mirrors.",exc
" So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as long as we can, like little quiet idiotic school children.",exc
" [garbage] Darling, kiss me before your body rots and worms start popping in and out of your eye sockets.",exc
" I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint your body bright green and and run naked through the Place Vendome and run with every man in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as I know that you love me best.",exc
 Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,exc
 The one where you bought that little painted wooden stake and you put it on my bed.,exc
 Horrible thing.  I hated it.,exc
 How long did that roue last?,exc
" Oh, The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown?",exc
" [LAUGHTER] That was quit a rouser, wasn't it?",exc
" Oh, I didn't hit you very hard.",exc
 I should never forget his face. [LAUGHTER],exc
 We were very much younger then.,exc
" Come to think of it, the real cause of that roues was Peter Burden.",xxx
 Oh You knew there was nothing in that.,xxx
 Only a trivial little broach.,neu
 Not at all.  I quite like it.  I wear it often.,neu
" [garbage], No, I didn't.  You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.",fru
" Oh, maybe a little.  Nothing serious.",neu
" Well, what of it.",neu
 Well it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.,neu
" Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious you never would have known about it.",xxx
 I'm getting very bored with this conversation.,fru
 No thanks.,neu
 I don't see why you want it; you've already had two glasses.,xxx
" Well, it seems silly to go on and on with such a thing.",xxx
 It's becoming a habit with you.,neu
 Don't be stupid.,fru
 What?,xxx
 Just making myself fascinating for you.,neu
" It's a woman's job to allure the man.  Watch me a moment, won't you?",xxx
" No, it isn't.",ang
" No, it it is not, be quiet.",ang
" hum, It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.",xxx
" Adders don't snap, they sting.",xxx
 They sting.,fru
" Okay, I don't care if they roll about like hoops and bark, okay?",xxx
" Yes, I did quite a lot.",neu
 [LAUGHTER] Mind your own business.,xxx
 You're quite insufferable.  I do imagine it's because you're drunk.,fru
 You always had a weak head.,neu
" Oh, no on the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass.",xxx
 Not- Would you shut up.,ang
" You're not very funny, dear.  You better have some more brandy.",fru
 Why?,xxx
 There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photography studio.,xxx
 They're away in Tunis.,xxx
" Turn it on again, please.",xxx
 Very well.  If you have to be boorish and idiotic.,ang
 You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.,ang
 Go away!  Go away!  I- I hate you.,ang
" You know what, I'm sick and tire of listening to you.  You're a-- You're a total sadistic bully.",ang
" Stop.  Would you just go away?  I mean, you're conceited, and overbearing, and utterly impossible.",ang
 This is the end! Do you understand me? This is the end.,ang
" Yes, I am. Let go with me",ang
" You are a cruel fiend and I-I loath you.  I thank God I realized who you are before I decided to marry you again.  Oh my God, never!",ang
 Beast,ang
 Brute,ang
 pig,ang
 Come to think of it the real cause of that roue was Peter Burden.,xxx
 I knew nothing of the sort.  You accepted presents from him.,xxx
" I remember it well, covered in diamonds and the worst possible taste.",xxx
 You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,xxx
 You must admit that he was in love with you. wasn't he?,fru
 He let him kiss you.  You said you did.,fru
 what of it?,xxx
 What about me?,xxx
" Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.",ang
" Me, too, bored stiff.",ang
 Do you want some brandy?,neu
 I think I'll have a little.,neu
" No particular reason.  Besides, they were little ones.",xxx
 You can hardly say- You can hardly call three little liquor glasses of brandy for the entire evening going on and on.,xxx
 You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want me at the moment.,xxx
" Amanda, really.",ang
" Nothing.  Are you going out somewhere, darling?",fru
" Um- Well, that reply has just broken my heart.",fru
" Oh, as a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.",xxx
" Yes, it is.",xxx
 It's a pity you didn't have a little bit more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.,ang
" oh, Snap, snap, snap.  Like a little Adder.",xxx
" Nonsense, they've got a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap!",fru
 They snap.,ang
" So, did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?",neu
" You must have let him kiss you quite a good deal more then, huh?",ang
" I'm sure you had a riotous time, no restrain at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyway.",ang
 I am not the slightest bit drunk.,ang
 I do believe that I have said already that I had three minuet liquor glasses of brandy in the entire evening.  A child of two couldn't get drunk of that.,ang
" Oh, really?  How about a child of three, or child of six, what about a child of nine?",ang
" You know, we could get a really good debate going on about this.  You know intemperate tots.",ang
 You know what?  That's a very good idea.  I think I will.,ang
" You better turn that off, I think.",ang
 Because it's very late and you'll disturb the people upstairs.,ang
" Well, there are people downstairs, I suppose.",ang
 This is no time of the year for Tunis.,ang
 I do I shall do no such thing.,ang
 Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.,ang
 Turn it off!,ang
 Very amusing indeed.,ang
 Ja! Very funny.,ang
" You are a vile tempered, wicked living, evil little beast.  And I hope I never set eyes on you ever again.",ang
" Oh, you're not going like this.",ang
" [GARBAGE] No, you're not.",ang
 oh! Marry you again? I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee.,ang
 You're a wicked little vampire.  And I pray to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live.,ang
